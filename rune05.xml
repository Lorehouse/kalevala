    <head type="title">WAINAVOINEN’S LAMENTATION.</head>
    <lg>
        <l>Far and wide the tidings travelled,</l>
        <l>Far away men heard the story</l>
        <l>Of the flight and death of Aino,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Fairest daughter of creation.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, brave and truthful,</l>
        <l>Straightway fell to bitter weeping,</l>
        <l>Wept at morning, wept at evening,</l>
        <l>Sleepless, wept the dreary night long,</l>
        <l>That his Aino had departed,</l>
        <l>That the maiden thus had vanished,</l>
        <l>Thus had sunk upon the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the blue-sea, deep and boundless.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Filled with grief, the ancient singer,</l>
        <l>Wainamoinen of the Northland,</l>
        <l>Heavy-hearted, sorely weeping,</l>
        <l>Hastened to the restless waters,</l>
        <l>This the suitor’s prayer and question:</l>
        <l>“Tell, Untamo, tell me, dreamer,</l>
        <l>Tell me, Indolence, thy visions,</l>
        <l>Where the water-gods may linger,</l>
        <l>Where may rest Wellamo’s maidens?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then Untamo thus made answer,</l>
        <l>Lazily he told his dreamings:</l>
        <l>“Over there, the mermaid-dwellings,</l>
        <l>Yonder live Wellamo’s maidens,</l>
        <l>On the headland robed in verdure,</l>
        <l>On the forest-covered island,</l>
        <l>In the deep, pellucid waters,</l>
        <l>On the purple-colored sea-shore;</l>
        <l>Yonder is the home of sea-maids,</l>
        <l>There the maidens of Wellamo,</l>
        <l>Live there in their sea-side chambers,</l>
        <l>Rest within their water-caverns,</l>
        <l>On the rocks of rainbow colors,</l>
        <l>On the juttings of the sea-cliffs.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Straightway hastens Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>To a boat-house on the sea-shore,</l>
        <l>Looks with care upon the fish-hooks,</l>
        <l>And the lines he well considers;</l>
        <l>Lines, and hooks, and poles, and fish-nets,</l>
        <l>Places in a boat of copper,</l>
        <l>Then begins he swiftly rowing</l>
        <l>To the forest-covered island,</l>
        <l>To the point enrobed in verdure,</l>
        <l>To the purple-colored headland,</l>
        <l>Where the sea-nymphs live and linger.</l>
        <l>Hardly does he reach the island</l>
        <l>Ere the minstrel starts to angle;</l>
        <l>Far away he throws his fish-hook,</l>
        <l>Trolls it quickly through the waters,</l>
        <l>Turning on a copper swivel</l>
        <l>Dangling from a silver fish-line,</l>
        <l>Golden is the hook he uses.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Now he tries his silken fish-net,</l>
        <l>Angles long, and angles longer,</l>
        <l>Angles one day, then a second,</l>
        <l>In the morning, in the evening,</l>
        <l>Angles at the hour of noontide,</l>
        <l>Many days and nights he angles,</l>
        <l>Till at last, one sunny morning,</l>
        <l>Strikes a fish of magic powers,</l>
        <l>Plays like salmon on his fish-line,</l>
        <l>Lashing waves across the waters,</l>
        <l>Till at length the fish exhausted</l>
        <l>Falls a victim to the angler,</l>
        <l>Safely landed in the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the hero’s boat of copper.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, proudly viewing,</l>
        <l>Speaks these words in wonder guessing:</l>
        <l>“This the fairest of all sea-fish,</l>
        <l>Never have I seen its equal,</l>
        <l>Smoother surely than the salmon,</l>
        <l>Brighter-spotted than the trout is,</l>
        <l>Grayer than the pike of Suomi,</l>
        <l>Has less fins than any female,</l>
        <l>Not the fins of any male fish,</l>
        <l>Not the stripes of sea-born maidens,</l>
        <l>Not the belt of any mermaid,</l>
        <l>Not the ears of any song-bird,</l>
        <l>Somewhat like our Northland salmon</l>
        <l>From the blue-sea’s deepest caverns.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>In his belt the ancient hero</l>
        <l>Wore a knife insheathed with silver;</l>
        <l>From its case he drew the fish-knife,</l>
        <l>Thus to carve the fish in pieces,</l>
        <l>Dress the nameless fish for roasting,</l>
        <l>Make of it a dainty breakfast,</l>
        <l>Make of it a meal at noon-day,</l>
        <l>Make for him a toothsome supper,</l>
        <l>Make the later meal at evening.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Straightway as the fish he touches,</l>
        <l>Touches with his knife of silver,</l>
        <l>Quick it leaps upon the waters,</l>
        <l>Dives beneath the sea’s smooth surface,</l>
        <l>From the boat with copper bottom,</l>
        <l>From the skiff of Wainamoinen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>In the waves at goodly distance,</l>
        <l>Quickly from the sea it rises</l>
        <l>On the sixth and seventh billows,</l>
        <l>Lifts its head above the waters,</l>
        <l>Out of reach of fishing-tackle,</l>
        <l>Then addresses Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Chiding thus the ancient hero:</l>
        <l>“Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</l>
        <l>Do not think that I came hither</l>
        <l>To be fished for as a salmon,</l>
        <l>Only to be chopped in pieces,</l>
        <l>Dressed and eaten like a whiting</l>
        <l>Make for thee a dainty breakfast,</l>
        <l>Make for thee a meal at midday,</l>
        <l>Make for thee a toothsome supper,</l>
        <l>Make the fourth meal of the Northland.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Wherefore didst thou then come hither,</l>
        <l>If it be not for my dinner?”</l>
        <l>Thus the nameless fish made answer:</l>
        <l>“Hither have I come, O minstrel,</l>
        <l>In thine arms to rest and linger,</l>
        <l>And thyself to love and cherish,</l>
        <l>At thy side a life-companion,</l>
        <l>And thy wife to be forever;</l>
        <l>Deck thy couch with snowy linen,</l>
        <l>Smooth thy head upon the pillow,</l>
        <l>Sweep thy rooms and make them cheery,</l>
        <l>Keep thy dwelling-place in order,</l>
        <l>Build a fire for thee when needed,</l>
        <l>Bake for thee the honey-biscuit,</l>
        <l>Fill thy cup with barley-water,</l>
        <l>Do for thee whatever pleases.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“I am not a scaly sea-fish,</l>
        <l>Not a trout of Northland rivers,</l>
        <l>Not a whiting from the waters,</l>
        <l>Not a salmon of the North-seas,</l>
        <l>I, a young and merry maiden,</l>
        <l>Friend and sister of the fishes,</l>
        <l>Youkahainen’s youngest sister,</l>
        <l>I, the one that thou dost fish for,</l>
        <l>I am Aino whom thou lovest.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Once thou wert the wise-tongued hero,</l>
        <l>Now the foolish Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Scant of insight, scant of judgment,</l>
        <l>Didst not know enough to keep me,</l>
        <l>Cruel-hearted, bloody-handed,</l>
        <l>Tried to kill me with thy fish-knife,</l>
        <l>So to roast me for thy dinner;</l>
        <l>I, a mermaid of Wellamo,</l>
        <l>Once the fair and lovely Aino,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:,</l>
        <l>Filled with sorrow, much regretting:</l>
        <l>“Since thou’rt Youkahainen’s sister,</l>
        <l>Beauteous Aino of Pohyola,</l>
        <l>Come to me again I pray thee!”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus the mermaid wisely answered:</l>
        <l>“Nevermore will Aino’s spirit</l>
        <l>Fly to thee and be ill-treated.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Quickly dived the water-maiden</l>
        <l>From the surface of the billow</l>
        <l>To the many-colored pebbles,</l>
        <l>To the rainbow-tinted grottoes</l>
        <l>Where the mermaids live and linger.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, not discouraged,</l>
        <l>Thought afresh and well reflected,</l>
        <l>How to live, and work, and win her;</l>
        <l>Drew with care his silken fish-net,</l>
        <l>To and fro through foam and billow,</l>
        <l>Through the bays and winding channels,</l>
        <l>Drew it through the placid waters,</l>
        <l>Drew it through the salmon-dwellings,</l>
        <l>Through the homes of water-maidens,</l>
        <l>Through the waters of Wainola,</l>
        <l>Through the blue-back of the ocean,</l>
        <l>Through the lakes of distant Lapland,</l>
        <l>Through the rivers of Youkola,</l>
        <l>Through the seas of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Hoping thus to find his Aino.</l>
        <l>Many were the fish he landed,</l>
        <l>Every form of fish-like creatures,</l>
        <l>But he did not catch the sea-maid,</l>
        <l>Not Wellamo’s water-maiden,</l>
        <l>Fairest daughter of the Northland.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Finally the ancient minstrel,</l>
        <l>Mind depressed, and heart discouraged,</l>
        <l>Spake these words, immersed in sorrow:</l>
        <l>“Fool am I, and great my folly,</l>
        <l>Having neither wit nor judgment;</l>
        <l>Surely once I had some knowledge,</l>
        <l>Had some insight into wisdom,</l>
        <l>Had at least a bit of instinct;</l>
        <l>But my virtues all have left me</l>
        <l>In these mournful days of evil,</l>
        <l>Vanished with my youth and vigor,</l>
        <l>Insight gone, and sense departed,</l>
        <l>All my prudence gone to others!</l>
        <l>Aino, whom I love and cherish,</l>
        <l>All these years have sought to honor,</l>
        <l>Aino, now Wellamo’s maiden,</l>
        <l>Promised friend of mine when needed,</l>
        <l>Promised bride of mine forever,</l>
        <l>Once I had within my power,</l>
        <l>Caught her in Wellamo’s grottoes,</l>
        <l>Led her to my boat of copper,</l>
        <l>With my fish-line made of silver;</l>
        <l>But alas! I could not keep her,</l>
        <l>Did not know that I had caught her</l>
        <l>Till too late to woo and win her;</l>
        <l>Let her slip between my fingers</l>
        <l>To the home of water-maidens,</l>
        <l>To the kingdom of Wellamo.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen then departed,</l>
        <l>Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,</l>
        <l>Straightway hastened to his country,</l>
        <l>To his home in Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Spake these words upon his journey:</l>
        <l>“What has happened to the cuckoo,</l>
        <l>Once the cuckoo bringing gladness,</l>
        <l>In the morning, in the evening,</l>
        <l>Often bringing joy at noontide?</l>
        <l>What has stilled the cuckoo’s singing,</l>
        <l>What has changed the cuckoo’s calling?</l>
        <l>Sorrow must have stilled his singing,</l>
        <l>And compassion changed his calling,</l>
        <l>As I hear him sing no longer,</l>
        <l>For my pleasure in the morning,</l>
        <l>For my happiness at evening.</l>
        <l>Never shall I learn the secret,</l>
        <l>How to live and how to prosper,</l>
        <l>How upon the earth to rest me,</l>
        <l>How upon the seas to wander!</l>
        <l>Only were my ancient mother</l>
        <l>Living on the face of Northland,</l>
        <l>Surely she would well advise me,</l>
        <l>What my thought and what my action,</l>
        <l>That this cup of grief might pass me,</l>
        <l>That this sorrow might escape me,</l>
        <l>And this darkened cloud pass over.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>In the deep awoke his mother,</l>
        <l>From her tomb she spake as follows:</l>
        <l>“Only sleeping was thy mother,</l>
        <l>Now awakes to give thee answer,</l>
        <l>What thy thought and what thine action,</l>
        <l>That this cup of grief may pass thee,</l>
        <l>That this sorrow may escape thee,</l>
        <l>And this darkened cloud pass over.</l>
        <l>Hie thee straightway to the Northland,</l>
        <l>Visit thou the Suomi daughters;</l>
        <l>Thou wilt find them wise and lovely,</l>
        <l>Far more beautiful than Aino,</l>
        <l>Far more worthy of a husband,</l>
        <l>Not such silly chatter-boxes,</l>
        <l>As the fickle Lapland maidens.</l>
        <l>Take for thee a life-companion,</l>
        <l>From the honest homes of Suomi,</l>
        <l>One of Northland’s honest daughters;</l>
        <l>She will charm thee with her sweetness,</l>
        <l>Make thee happy through her goodness,</l>
        <l>Form perfection, manners easy,</l>
        <l>Every step and movement graceful,</l>
        <l>Full of wit and good behavior,</l>
        <l>Honor to thy home and kindred.”</l>
    </lg>
