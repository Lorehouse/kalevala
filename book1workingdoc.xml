<head>BIRTH OF VÄINÄMÖINEN</head>
<div type="argument">Prelude (1-102). The Virgin of the Air descends into the sea, where she is fertilized by the winds and waves and becomes the Water-Mother (103-176). A teal builds its nest on her knee, and lays eggs (177-212). The eggs fall from the nest and break, but the fragments form the earth, sky, sun, moon and clouds (213-244). The Water-Mother creates capes, bays, sea-shores, and the depths and shallows of the ocean (245-280). Väinämöinen is born from the Water-Mother, and is tossed about by the waves for a long time until he reaches the shore (281-344).

<l n="01.001">I am driven by my longing,</l>
<l n="01.002">And my understanding urges</l>
<l n="01.003">That I should commence my singing;</l>
<l n="01.004">And begin my recitation.</l>
<l n="01.005">I will sing the people's legends,</l>
<l n="01.006">And the ballads of the nation.</l>
<l n="01.007">To my mouth the words are flowing,</l>
<l n="01.008">And the words are gently falling,</l>
<l n="01.009">Quickly as my tongue can shape them,</l>
<l n="01.010">And between my teeth emerging.</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>

<l n="01.011">Dearest friend, and much-loved brother,</l>
<l n="01.012">Best beloved of all companions,</l>
<l n="01.013">Come and let us sing together,</l>
<l n="01.014">Let us now begin our converse,</l>
<l n="01.015">Since at length we meet together,</l>
<l n="01.016">From two widely sundered regions.</l>
<l n="01.017">Rarely can we meet together,</l>
<l n="01.018">Rarely one can meet the other,</l>
<l n="01.019">In these dismal Northern regions,</l>
<l n="01.020">In the dreary land of Pohja.</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="01.021">Let us clasp our hands together,</l>
<l n="01.022">Let us interlock our fingers;</l>
<l n="01.023">Let us sing a cheerful measure,</l>
<l n="01.024">Let us use our best endeavours,</l>
<l n="01.025">While our dear ones hearken to us,</l>
<l n="01.026">And our loved ones are instructed,</l>
<l n="01.027">While the young are standing round us,</l>
<l n="01.028">Of the rising generation,</l>
<l n="01.029">Let them learn the words of magic.</l>
<l n="01.030">And recall our songs and legends,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="01.031">Of the belt of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="01.032">Of the forge of Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="01.033">And of Kaukomieli's sword-point,</l>
<l n="01.034">And of Joukahainen's crossbow:</l>
<l n="01.035">Of the utmost bounds of Pohja,</l>
<l n="01.036">And of Kalevala's wide heathlands.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.037">These my father sang aforetime,</l>
<l n="01.038">As he carved his hatchet's handle,</l>
<l n="01.039">And my mother taught me likewise,</l>
<l n="01.040">As she turned around her spindle,</l>
<l n="01.041">When upon the floor, an infant,</l>
<l n="01.042">At her knees she saw me tumbling,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="01.043">As a helpless child, milk-bearded,</l>
<l n="01.044">As a babe with mouth all milky.</l>
<l n="01.045">Tales about the Sampo failed not,</l>
<l n="01.046">Nor the magic spells of Louhi.</l>
<l n="01.047">Old at length became the Sampo;</l>
<l n="01.048">Louhi vanished with her magic;</l>
<l n="01.049">Vipunen while singing perished;</l>
<l n="01.050">Lemminkainen in his follies.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.051">There are many other legends;</l>
<l n="01.052">Songs I learned of magic import;</l>
<l n="01.053">Some beside the pathway gathered;</l>
<l n="01.054">Others broken from the heather;</l>
<l n="01.055">Others wrested from the bushes;</l>
<l n="01.056">Others taken from the saplings,</l>
<l n="01.057">Gathered from the springing verdure,</l>
<l n="01.058">Or collected from the by-ways,</l>
<l n="01.059">As I passed along as herd-boy,</l>
<l n="01.060">As a child in cattle pastures,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="01.061">On the hillocks, rich in honey,</l>
<l n="01.062">On the hills, for ever golden,</l>

<l n="01.064">By the side of dappled Kimmo.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.065">Then the Frost his songs recited,</l>
<l n="01.066">And the rain its legends taught me;</l>
<l n="01.067">Other songs the winds have wafted,</l>
<l n="01.068">Or the ocean waves have drifted;</l>
<l n="01.069">And their songs the birds have added,</l>
<l n="01.070">And the magic spells the tree-tops.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.071">In a ball I bound them tightly;</l>
<l n="01.072">And arranged them in a bundle;</l>
<l n="01.073">On my little sledge I laid it,</l>
<l n="01.074">On my sleigh I laid the bundle;</l>
<l n="01.075">Home upon the sledge I brought it,</l>
<l n="01.076">Then into the barn conveyed it;</l>
<l n="01.077">In the storehouse loft I placed it,</l>
<l n="01.078">In a little box of copper.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.079">In the cold my song was resting,</l>
<l n="01.080">Long remained in darkness hidden.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="01.081">I must draw the songs from Coldness,</l>
<l n="01.082">From the Frost must I withdraw them,</l>
<l n="01.083">Bring my box into the chamber,</l>
<l n="01.084">On the bench-end lay the casket,</l>
<l n="01.085">Underneath this noble gable,</l>
<l n="01.086">Underneath this roof of beauty.</l>
<l n="01.087">Shall I ope my box of legends,</l>
<l n="01.088">And my chest where lays are treasured?</l>
<l n="01.089">Is the ball to be unravelled,</l>
<l n="01.090">And the bundle's knot unfastened?</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="01.091">Then I'll sing so grand a ballad,</l>
<l n="01.092">That it wondrously shall echo,</l>
<l n="01.093">While the ryebread I am eating,</l>
<l n="01.094">And the beer of barley drinking.</l>
<l n="01.095">But though ale should not be brought me,</l>
<l n="01.096">And though beer should not be offered,</l>
<l n="01.097">I will sing, though dry my throttle,</l>
<l n="01.098">Or will sing, with water only,</l>
<l n="01.099">To enhance our evening's pleasure,</l>
<l n="01.100">Celebrate the daylight's beauty,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="01.101">Or the beauty of the daybreak,</l>
<l n="01.102">When another day is dawning.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.103">I have often heard related,</l>
<l n="01.104">And have heard the song recited,</l>
<l n="01.105">How the nights closed ever lonely,</l>
<l n="01.106">And the days were shining lonely.</l>
<l n="01.107">Only born was Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="01.108">And revealed the bard immortal,</l>
<l n="01.109">Sprung from the divine Creatrix,</l>
<l n="01.110">Born of Ilmatar, his mother.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.111">Air's young daughter was a virgin,</l>
<l n="01.112">Fairest daughter of Creation.</l>
<l n="01.113">Long did she abide a virgin,</l>
<l n="01.114">All the long days of her girlhood,</l>
<l n="01.115">In the Air's own spacious mansions,</l>
<l n="01.116">In those far extending regions.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.117">Wearily the time passed ever.</l>
<l n="01.118">And her life became a burden,</l>
<l n="01.119">Dwelling evermore so lonely,</l>
<l n="01.120">Always living as a maiden,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="01.121">In the Air's own spacious mansions,</l>
<l n="01.122">In those far-extending deserts.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.123">After this the maid descending,</l>
<l n="01.124">Sank upon the tossing billows,</l>
<l n="01.125">On the open ocean's surface,</l>
<l n="01.126">On the wide expanse of water.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.127">Then a storm arose in fury,</l>
<l n="01.128">From the East a mighty tempest,</l>
<l n="01.129">And the sea was wildly foaming,</l>
<l n="01.130">And the waves dashed ever higher.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.131">Thus the tempest rocked the virgin,</l>
<l n="01.132">And the billows drove the maiden,</l>
<l n="01.133">O'er the ocean's azure surface,</l>
<l n="01.134">On the crest of foaming billows,</l>
<l n="01.135">Till the wind that blew around her,</l>
<l n="01.136">And the sea woke life within her.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.137">Then she bore her heavy burden,</l>
<l n="01.138">And the pain it brought upon her,</l>
<l n="01.139">Seven long centuries together,</l>
<l n="01.140">Nine times longer than a lifetime.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="01.141">Yet no child was fashioned from her,</l>
<l n="01.142">And no offspring was perfected.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.143">Thus she swam, the Water-Mother,</l>
<l n="01.144">East she swam, and westward swam she,</l>
<l n="01.145">Swam to north-west and to south-west,</l>
<l n="01.146">And around in all directions,</l>
<l n="01.147">In the sharpness of her torment,</l>
<l n="01.148">In her body's fearful anguish;</l>
<l n="01.149">Yet no child was fashioned from her,</l>
<l n="01.150">And no offspring was perfected.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.151">Then she fell to weeping gently,</l>
<l n="01.152">And in words like these expressed her:</l>
<l n="01.153">"O how wretched is my fortune,</l>
<l n="01.154">Wandering thus, a child unhappy!</l>
<l n="01.155">I have wandered far already,</l>
<l n="01.156">And I dwell beneath the heaven,</l>
<l n="01.157">By the tempest tossed for ever,</l>
<l n="01.158">While the billows drive me onward.</l>
<l n="01.159">O'er this wide expanse of water,</l>
<l n="01.160">On the far-extending billows.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.161">"Better were it had I tarried,</l>
<l n="01.162">Virgin in aerial regions,</l>
<l n="01.163">Then I should not drift for ever,</l>
<l n="01.164">As the Mother of the Waters.</l>
<l n="01.165">Here my life is cold and dreary,</l>
<l n="01.166">Every moment now is painful,</l>
<l n="01.167">Ever tossing on the billows,</l>
<l n="01.168">Ever floating on the water.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.169">"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="01.170">Ruler of the whole of heaven,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="01.171">Hasten here, for thou art needed;</l>
<l n="01.172">Hasten here at my entreaty.</l>
<l n="01.173">Free the damsel from her burden,</l>
<l n="01.174">And release her from her tortures.</l>
<l n="01.175">Quickly haste, and yet more quickly,</l>
<l n="01.176">Where I long for thee so sorely."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.177">Short the time that passed thereafter,</l>
<l n="01.178">Scarce a moment had passed over,</l>
<l n="01.179">Ere a beauteous teal came flying</l>
<l n="01.180">Lightly hovering o'er the water,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="01.181">Seeking for a spot to rest in,</l>
<l n="01.182">Searching for a home to dwell in.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.183">Eastward flew she, westward flew she.</l>
<l n="01.184">Flew to north-west and to southward,</l>
<l n="01.185">But the place she sought she found not,</l>
<l n="01.186">Not a spot, however barren,</l>
<l n="01.187">Where her nest she could establish,</l>
<l n="01.188">Or a resting-place could light on.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.189">Then she hovered, slowly moving,</l>
<l n="01.190">And she pondered and reflected,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="01.191">"If my nest in wind I 'stablish</l>
<l n="01.192">Or should rest it on the billows,</l>
<l n="01.193">Then the winds will overturn it,</l>
<l n="01.194">Or the waves will drift it from me."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.195">Then the Mother of the Waters,</l>
<l n="01.196">Water-Mother, maid aerial,</l>
<l n="01.197">From the waves her knee uplifted,</l>
<l n="01.198">Raised her shoulder from the billows,</l>
<l n="01.199">That the teal her nest might 'stablish,</l>
<l n="01.200">And might find a peaceful dwelling.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="01.201">Then the teal, the bird so beauteous,</l>
<l n="01.202">Hovered slow, and gazed around her,</l>
<l n="01.203">And she saw the knee uplifted</l>
<l n="01.204">From the blue waves of the ocean,</l>
<l n="01.205">And she thought she saw a hillock,</l>
<l n="01.206">Freshly green with springing verdure.</l>
<l n="01.207">There she flew, and hovered slowly,</l>
<l n="01.208">Gently on the knee alighting,</l>
<l n="01.209">And her nest she there established,</l>
<l n="01.210">And she laid her eggs all golden,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="01.211">Six gold eggs she laid within it,</l>
<l n="01.212">And a seventh she laid of iron.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.213">O'er her eggs the teal sat brooding,</l>
<l n="01.214">And the knee grew warm beneath her;</l>
<l n="01.215">And she sat one day, a second,</l>
<l n="01.216">Brooded also on the third day;</l>
<l n="01.217">Then the Mother of the Waters,</l>
<l n="01.218">Water-Mother, maid aerial,</l>
<l n="01.219">Felt it hot, and felt it hotter,</l>
<l n="01.220">And she felt her skin was heated,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="01.221">Till she thought her knee was burning,</l>
<l n="01.222">And that all her veins were melting.</l>
<l n="01.223">Then she jerked her knee with quickness,</l>
<l n="01.224">And her limbs convulsive shaking,</l>
<l n="01.225">Rolled the eggs into the water,</l>
<l n="01.226">Down amid the waves of ocean,</l>
<l n="01.227">And to splinters they were broken,</l>
<l n="01.228">And to fragments they were shattered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.229">In the ooze they were not wasted,</l>
<l n="01.230">Nor the fragments in the water,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="01.231">But a wondrous change came o'er them,</l>
<l n="01.232">And the fragments all grew lovely.</l>
<l n="01.233">From the cracked egg's lower fragment,</l>
<l n="01.234">Now the solid earth was fashioned,</l>
<l n="01.235">From the cracked egg's upper fragment,</l>
<l n="01.236">Rose the lofty arch of heaven,</l>
<l n="01.237">From the yolk, the upper portion,</l>
<l n="01.238">Now became the sun's bright lustre;</l>
<l n="01.239">From the white, the upper portion,</l>

<l n="01.241">Whatso in the egg was mottled,</l>

<l n="01.244">In the air as cloudlets floated.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.245">Now the time passed quickly over,</l>
<l n="01.246">And the years rolled quickly onward,</l>
<l n="01.247">In the new sun's shining lustre,</l>
<l n="01.248">In the new moon's softer beaming.</l>
<l n="01.249">Still the Water-Mother floated,</l>

<l n="01.251">Ever on the peaceful waters,</l>

<l n="01.255">When the ninth year had passed over,</l>
<l n="01.256">And the summer tenth was passing,</l>
<l n="01.257">From the sea her head she lifted,</l>
<l n="01.258">And her forehead she uplifted,</l>

<l n="01.271">Where her feet to land extended,</l>

<l n="01.275">Further from the land she floated,</l>
<l n="01.276">And abode in open water,</l>
<l n="01.277">And created rocks in ocean,</l>
<l n="01.278">And the reefs that eyes behold not,</l>
<l n="01.279">Where the ships are often shattered,</l>
<l n="01.280">And the sailors' lives are ended.</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.281">Now the isles were formed already,</l>
<l n="01.282">In the sea the rocks were planted;</l>
<l n="01.283">Pillars of the sky established,</l>
<l n="01.284">Lands and continents created;</l>
<l n="01.285">Rocks engraved as though with figures,</l>

<l n="01.287">Still unborn was Väinämöinen;</l>
<l n="01.288">Still unborn, the bard immortal.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.289">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="01.290">Rested in his mother's body"</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="01.291">For the space of thirty summers,</l>
<l n="01.292">And the sum of thirty winters,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.295">So he pondered and reflected</l>
<l n="01.296">How he could continue living</l>
<l n="01.297">In a resting-place so gloomy,</l>
<l n="01.298">In a dwelling far too narrow,</l>
<l n="01.299">Where he could not see the moonlight,</l>
<l n="01.300">Neither could behold the sunlight.</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.301">Then he spake the words which follow,</l>
<l n="01.302">And expressed his thoughts in this wise:</l>

<lg>
<l n="01.303">"Aid me Moon, and Sun release me,</l>

<l n="01.307">From the little nest that holds me,</l>
<l n="01.308">From a dwelling-place so narrow,</l>
<l n="01.309">To the land conduct the roamer,</l>
<l n="01.310">To the open air conduct me,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="01.311">To behold the moon in heaven,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.315">When the moon no freedom gave him,</l>

<l n="01.319">Thereupon he moved the portal,</l>
<l n="01.320">With his finger, fourth in number,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="01.321">Opened quick the bony gateway,</l>
<l n="01.322">With the toes upon his left foot,</l>
<l n="01.323">With his nails beyond the threshold,</l>
<l n="01.324">With his knees beyond the gateway.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.325">Headlong in the water falling,</l>
<l n="01.326">With his hands the waves repelling,</l>
<l n="01.327">Thus the man remained in ocean,</l>
<l n="01.328">And the hero on the billows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.329">In the sea five years he sojourned,</l>
<l n="01.330">Waited five years, waited six years,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="01.331">Seven years also, even eight years,</l>
<l n="01.332">On the surface of the ocean,</l>
<l n="01.333">By a nameless promontory,</l>
<l n="01.334">Near a barren, treeless country.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.335">On the land his knees he planted,</l>
<l n="01.336">And upon his arms he rested,</l>
<l n="01.337">Rose that he might view the moonbeams,</l>
<l n="01.338">And enjoy the pleasant sunlight,</l>
<l n="01.339">See the Great Bear's stars above him,</l>
<l n="01.340">And the shining stars in heaven.</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="01.341">Thus was ancient Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="01.342">He, the ever famous minstrel,</l>
<l n="01.343">Born of the divine Creatrix,</l>
<l n="01.344">Born of Ilmatar, his mother.</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN'S SOWING</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen lands on a treeless country and directs Sampsa Pellervoinen to sow trees (1-42). At first the oak will not grow, but after repeated sowings it springs up, overshadows the whole country, and hides the sun and moon (43-110). A little man rises from the sea, who fells the oak, and permits the sun and moon to shine again (111-224). Birds sing in the trees; herbs, flowers and berries grow on the ground; only the barley will not spring up (225-256). Väinämöinen finds some barleycorns in the sand on the shore, and fells the forest, leaving only a birch-tree as a resting-place for the birds (257-264). The eagle, grateful for this, strikes fire, and the felled trees are consumed (265-284). Väinämöinen sows the barley, prays to Ukko for its increase, and it grows and flourishes (285-378).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="02.001">Then did Väinämöinen, rising,</l>
<l n="02.002">Set his feet upon the surface</l>
<l n="02.003">Of a sea-encircled island,</l>
<l n="02.004">In a region bare of forest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.005">There he dwelt, while years passed over,</l>
<l n="02.006">And his dwelling he established</l>
<l n="02.007">On the silent, voiceless island,</l>
<l n="02.008">In a barren, treeless country.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.009">Then he pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="02.010">In his mind he turned it over,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="02.011">"Who shall sow this barren country,</l>
<l n="02.012">Thickly scattering seeds around him?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.013">Pellervoinen, earth-begotten,</l>
<l n="02.014">Sampsa, youth of smallest stature,</l>
<l n="02.015">Came to sow the barren country,</l>
<l n="02.016">Thickly scattering seeds around him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.017">Down he stooped the seeds to scatter,</l>
<l n="02.018">On the land and in the marshes,</l>
<l n="02.019">Both in flat and sandy regions,</l>
<l n="02.020">And in hard and rocky places.</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="02.021">On the hills he sowed the pine-trees,</l>
<l n="02.022">On the knolls he sowed the fir-trees,</l>
<l n="02.023">And in sandy places heather;</l>
<l n="02.024">Leafy saplings in the valleys.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.025">In the dales he sowed the birch-trees,</l>
<l n="02.026">In the loose earth sowed the alders,</l>
<l n="02.027">Where the ground was damp the cherries,</l>
<l n="02.028">Likewise in the marshes, sallows.</l>
<l n="02.029">Rowan-trees in holy places,</l>
<l n="02.030">Willows in the fenny regions,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="02.031">Juniper in stony districts,</l>
<l n="02.032">Oaks upon the banks of rivers.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.033">Now the trees sprang up and flourished,</l>
<l n="02.034">And the saplings sprouted bravely.</l>
<l n="02.035">With their bloom the firs were loaded,</l>
<l n="02.036">And the pines their boughs extended.</l>
<l n="02.037">In the dales the birch was sprouting,</l>
<l n="02.038">In the loose earth rose the alders,</l>
<l n="02.039">Where the ground was damp the cherries,</l>
<l n="02.040">Juniper in stony districts,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="02.041">Loaded with its lovely berries;</l>
<l n="02.042">And the cherries likewise fruited.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.043">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="02.044">Came to view the work in progress,</l>
<l n="02.045">Where the land was sown by Sampsa,</l>
<l n="02.046">And where Pellervoinen laboured.</l>
<l n="02.047">While he saw the trees had flourished,</l>
<l n="02.048">And the saplings sprouted bravely,</l>
<l n="02.049">Yet had Jumala's tree, the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.050">Not struck down its root and sprouted.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.051">Therefore to its fate he left it,</l>
<l n="02.052">Left it to enjoy its freedom,</l>
<l n="02.053">And he waited three nights longer,</l>
<l n="02.054">And as many days he waited.</l>
<l n="02.055">Then he went and gazed around him,</l>
<l n="02.056">When the week was quite completed.</l>
<l n="02.057">Yet had Jumala's tree, the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.058">Not struck down its root and sprouted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.059">Then he saw four lovely maidens;</l>
<l n="02.060">Five, like brides, from water rising;</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="02.061">And they mowed the grassy meadow,</l>
<l n="02.062">Down they cut the dewy herbage,</l>
<l n="02.063">On the cloud-encompassed headland,</l>
<l n="02.064">On the peaceful island's summit,</l>
<l n="02.065">What they mowed, they raked together,</l>
<l n="02.066">And in heaps the hay collected.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.067">From the ocean rose up Tursas,</l>
<l n="02.068">From the waves arose the hero,</l>
<l n="02.069">And the heaps of hay he kindled,</l>
<l n="02.070">And the flames arose in fury.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="02.071">All was soon consumed to ashes,</l>
<l n="02.072">Till the sparks were quite extinguished.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.073">Then among the heaps of ashes,</l>
<l n="02.074">In the dryness of the ashes,</l>
<l n="02.075">There a tender germ he planted,</l>
<l n="02.076">Tender germ, of oak an acorn</l>
<l n="02.077">Whence the beauteous plant sprang upward,</l>
<l n="02.078">And the sapling grew and flourished,</l>
<l n="02.079">As from earth a strawberry rises,</l>
<l n="02.080">And it forked in both directions.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="02.081">Then the branches wide extended,</l>
<l n="02.082">And the leaves were thickly scattered,</l>
<l n="02.083">And the summit rose to heaven,</l>
<l n="02.084">And its leaves in air expanded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.085">In their course the clouds it hindered,</l>
<l n="02.086">And the driving clouds impeded,</l>
<l n="02.087">And it hid the shining sunlight,</l>
<l n="02.088">And the gleaming of the moonlight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.089">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="02.090">Pondered deeply and reflected,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="02.091">"Is there none to fell the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.092">And o'erthrow the tree majestic?</l>
<l n="02.093">Sad is now the life of mortals,</l>
<l n="02.094">And for fish to swim is dismal,</l>
<l n="02.095">Since the air is void of sunlight,</l>
<l n="02.096">And the gleaming of the moonlight."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.097">But they could not find a hero,</l>
<l n="02.098">Nowhere find a man so mighty,</l>
<l n="02.099">Who could fell the giant oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.100">With its hundred spreading branches.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.101">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="02.102">Spoke the very words which follow;</l>
<l n="02.103">"Noble mother, who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="02.104">Luonnotar, who me hast nurtured;</l>
<l n="02.105">Send me powers from out the ocean:</l>
<l n="02.106">(Numerous are the powers of ocean)</l>
<l n="02.107">So that they may fell the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.108">And destroy the tree so baneful,</l>
<l n="02.109">That the sun may shine upon us.</l>
<l n="02.110">And the pleasant moonlight glimmer."</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.111">Then a man arose from ocean,</l>
<l n="02.112">From the waves a hero started,</l>
<l n="02.113">Not the hugest of the hugest,</l>
<l n="02.114">Nor the smallest of the smallest.</l>
<l n="02.115">As a man's thumb was his stature;</l>
<l n="02.116">Lofty as the span of woman.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.117">Decked his head a helm of copper,</l>
<l n="02.118">On his feet were boots of copper,</l>
<l n="02.119">On his hands were copper gauntlets.</l>
<l n="02.120">Gloves adorned with copper tracings;</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="02.121">Round his waist his belt was copper;</l>
<l n="02.122">In his belt his axe was copper;</l>
<l n="02.123">And the haft thereof was thumb-long,</l>
<l n="02.124">And the blade thereof was nail-long.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.125">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="02.126">Deeply pondered and reflected:</l>
<l n="02.127">"While he seems a man in semblance,</l>
<l n="02.128">And a hero in appearance,</l>
<l n="02.129">Yet his height is but a thumb-length,</l>
<l n="02.130">Scarce as lofty as an ox-hoof."</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.131">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="02.132">And expressed himself in this wise:</l>
<l n="02.133">"Who are you, my little fellow,</l>
<l n="02.134">Most contemptible of heroes,</l>
<l n="02.135">Than a dead man scarcely stronger;</l>
<l n="02.136">And your beauty all has vanished."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.137">Then the puny man from ocean,</l>
<l n="02.138">Hero of the floods, made answer:</l>
<l n="02.139">"I'm a man as you behold me,</l>
<l n="02.140">Small, but mighty water-hero,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="02.141">I have come to fell the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.142">And to splinter it to fragments."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.143">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="02.144">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="02.145">"You have hardly been created,</l>
<l n="02.146">Neither made, nor so proportioned,</l>
<l n="02.147">As to fell this mighty oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.148">Overthrow the tree stupendous."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.149">Scarcely had the words been spoken,</l>
<l n="02.150">While his gaze was fixed upon him,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="02.151">When the man transformed before him,</l>
<l n="02.152">And became a mighty hero.</l>
<l n="02.153">While his feet the earth were stamping,</l>
<l n="02.154">To the clouds his head he lifted,</l>
<l n="02.155">To his knees his beard was flowing,</l>
<l n="02.156">To his spurs his locks descended.</l>
<l n="02.157">Fathom-wide his eyes were parted,</l>
<l n="02.158">Fathom-wide his trousers measured;</l>
<l n="02.159">Round his knee the girth was greater,</l>
<l n="02.160">And around his hip 'twas doubled.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="02.161">Then he sharpened keen the axe-blade,</l>
<l n="02.162">Brought the polished blade to sharpness;</l>
<l n="02.163">Six the stones on which he ground it,</l>
<l n="02.164">Seven the stones on which he whet it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.165">Then the man stepped forward lightly,</l>
<l n="02.166">Hastened on to do his mission;</l>
<l n="02.167">Wide his trousers, and they fluttered</l>
<l n="02.168">Round his legs as onward strode he,</l>
<l n="02.169">And the first step taken, brought him</l>
<l n="02.170">To the shore so soft and sandy;"</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="02.171">With the second stride he landed</l>
<l n="02.172">On the dun ground further inland,</l>
<l n="02.173">And the third step brought him quickly,</l>
<l n="02.174">Where the oak itself was rooted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.175">With his axe he smote the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.176">With his sharpened blade he hewed it;</l>
<l n="02.177">Once he smote it, twice he smote it,</l>
<l n="02.178">And the third stroke wholly cleft it.</l>
<l n="02.179">From the axe the flame was flashing,</l>
<l n="02.180">Flame was bursting from the oak-tree,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="02.181">As he strove to fell the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="02.182">Overthrow the tree stupendous.</l>
<l n="02.183">Thus the third blow was delivered,</l>
<l n="02.184">And the oak-tree fell before him,</l>
<l n="02.185">For the mighty tree was shattered,</l>
<l n="02.186">And the hundred boughs had fallen,</l>
<l n="02.187">And the trunk extended eastward,</l>
<l n="02.188">And the summit to the north-west,</l>
<l n="02.189">And the leaves were scattered southwards,</l>
<l n="02.190">And the branches to the northward.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.191">He who took a branch from off it,</l>

<l n="02.195">He who broke a leafy branchlet,</l>

<l n="02.197">What remained of fragments scattered,</l>
<l n="02.198">Chips of wood, and broken splinters,</l>
<l n="02.199">On the bright expanse of ocean,</l>
<l n="02.200">On the far-extending billows,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="02.201">In the breeze were gently rocking,</l>
<l n="02.202">On the waves were lightly drifted.</l>
<l n="02.203">Like the boats on ocean's surface,</l>
<l n="02.204">Like the ships amid the sea-waves.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.205">Northward drove the wind the fragments,</l>
<l n="02.206">Where the little maid of Pohja,</l>
<l n="02.207">Stood on beach, and washed her head-dress,</l>
<l n="02.208">And she washed her clothes and rinsed them,</l>
<l n="02.209">On the shingle by the ocean,</l>
<l n="02.210">On a tongue of land projecting.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.211">On the waves she saw the fragments,</l>
<l n="02.212">Put them in her birchbark wallet,</l>
<l n="02.213">In her wallet took them homeward;</l>
<l n="02.214">In the well-closed yard she stored them,</l>
<l n="02.215">For the arrows of the sorcerer,</l>
<l n="02.216">For the chase to furnish weapons.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.217">When the oak at last had fallen,</l>
<l n="02.218">And the evil tree was levelled,</l>
<l n="02.219">Once again the sun shone brightly,</l>
<l n="02.220">And the pleasant moonlight glimmered,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="02.221">And the clouds extended widely,</l>
<l n="02.222">And the rainbow spanned the heavens,</l>
<l n="02.223">O'er the cloud-encompassed headland,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.225">Then the wastes were clothed with verdure,</l>
<l n="02.226">And the woods grew up and flourished;</l>
<l n="02.227">Leaves on trees and grass in meadows.</l>
<l n="02.228">In the trees the birds were singing,</l>
<l n="02.229">Loudly sang the cheery throstle;</l>
<l n="02.230">In the tree-tops called the cuckoo.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.231">Then the earth brought forth her berries;</l>
<l n="02.232">Shone the fields with golden blossoms;</l>
<l n="02.233">Herbs of every species flourished;</l>
<l n="02.234">Plants and trees of all descriptions;</l>
<l n="02.235">But the barley would not flourish,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.237">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="02.238">Walked around, and deeply pondered,</l>
<l n="02.239">By the blue waves' sandy margin,</l>
<l n="02.240">On the mighty ocean's border,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="02.241">And six grains of corn he found there,</l>
<l n="02.242">Seven fine seeds of corn he found there,</l>
<l n="02.243">On the borders of the ocean,</l>
<l n="02.244">On the yielding sandy margin.</l>
<l n="02.245">In a marten's skin he placed them,</l>
<l n="02.246">From the leg of summer squirrel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.247">Then he went to sow the fallows;</l>
<l n="02.248">On the ground the seeds to scatter,</l>
<l n="02.249">Near to Kaleva's own fountain,</l>
<l n="02.250">And upon the field of Osmo.</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.251">From a tree there chirped the titmouse:</l>

<l n="02.254">While untilled remains the country,</l>

<l n="02.256">Nor the fire has burned it over."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.257">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="02.258">Ground his axe-blade edge to sharpness</l>
<l n="02.259">And began to fell the forest,</l>
<l n="02.260">Toiling hard to clear the country.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="02.261">All the lovely trees he levelled,</l>
<l n="02.262">Sparing but a single birch-tree,</l>
<l n="02.263">That the birds might rest upon it,</l>
<l n="02.264">And from thence might call the cuckoo.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.265">In the sky there soared an eagle,</l>
<l n="02.266">Of the birds of air the greatest,</l>
<l n="02.267">And he came and gazed around him.</l>
<l n="02.268">"Wherefore is the work unfinished,</l>

<l n="02.270">Wherefore spare the beauteous birch-tree?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.271">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="02.272">"Therefore is the birch left standing,</l>

<l n="02.274">All the birds of air may rest there."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="02.275">Said the bird of air, the eagle,</l>
<l n="02.276">"Very wisely hast thou acted,</l>
<l n="02.277">Thus to leave the birch-tree standing</l>

<lg>
<l n="02.281">Then the bird of air struck fire,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>

<l n="02.287">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN AND JOUKAHAINEN</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen increases in wisdom and composes songs (1-20). Joukahainen sets out to contend with him in wisdom; but as he cannot overcome him, he challenges him to a duel, whereupon Väinämöinen grows angry, and sinks him in a swamp by his magic songs (21-330). Joukahainen, in great distress, finally offers his sister Aino in marriage to Väinämöinen, who accepts the offer and releases him (331-476). Joukahainen returns home discomfited, and relates his misfortunes to his mother (477-524). The mother rejoices at the prospect of such an alliance, but the daughter laments and weeps (525-580).

<l n="03.033">That the songs of Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="03.034">Better than his own were reckoned.</l>
<l n="03.035">Then he went to seek his mother;</l>
<l n="03.036">Sought her out, the aged woman,</l>
<l n="03.037">And declared that he would journey,</l>

<l n="03.079">On he drove with thundering clatter,</l>

<l n="03.219">Hollowed out the depths of ocean,</l>
<l n="03.220">And I dug the caves for fishes,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="03.221">And I sunk the deep abysses,</l>
<l n="03.222">When the lakes I first created,</l>
<l n="03.223">And I heaped the hills together.</l>
<l n="03.224">And the rocky mountains fashioned.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.225">"Then I stood with six great heroes!</l>
<l n="03.226">I myself the seventh among them.</l>
<l n="03.227">When the earth was first created,</l>
<l n="03.228">And the air above expanded;</l>
<l n="03.229">For the sky I fixed the pillars.</l>
<l n="03.230">And I reared the arch of heaven,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="03.231">To the moon assigned his journey,</l>
<l n="03.232">Helped the sun upon his pathway,</l>
<l n="03.233">To the Bear his place appointed,</l>
<l n="03.234">And the stars in heaven I scattered,"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.235">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.236">"Ay, indeed, a shameless liar!</l>
<l n="03.237">You at least were never present</l>
<l n="03.238">When the ocean first was furrowed,</l>
<l n="03.239">And the ocean depths were hollowed.</l>
<l n="03.240">And the caves were dug for fishes,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="03.241">And the deep abysses sunken,</l>
<l n="03.242">And the lakes were first created,</l>
<l n="03.243">When the hills were heaped together,</l>
<l n="03.244">And the rocky mountains fashioned.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.245">"No one ever yet had seen you,</l>
<l n="03.246">None had seen you, none had heard you.</l>
<l n="03.247">When the earth was first created,</l>
<l n="03.248">And the air above expanded,</l>
<l n="03.249">When the posts of heaven were planted,</l>
<l n="03.250">And the arch of heaven exalted,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="03.251">When the moon was shown his pathway,</l>
<l n="03.252">And the sun was taught to journey,</l>
<l n="03.253">When the Bear was fixed in heaven,</l>
<l n="03.254">And the stars in heaven were scattered."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.255">But the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="03.256">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="03.257">"If I fail in understanding,</l>
<l n="03.258">I will seek it at the sword-point.</l>
<l n="03.259">O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.260">O thou very broad-mouthed minstrel,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="03.261">Let us measure swords together,</l>
<l n="03.262">Let the blade decide between us."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.263">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.264">"I have little cause to fret me</l>
<l n="03.265">Either for your sword or wisdom,</l>
<l n="03.266">For your sword-point or your judgment.</l>
<l n="03.267">But, apart from this at present,</l>
<l n="03.268">I will draw no sword upon you,</l>
<l n="03.269">So contemptible a fellow,</l>
<l n="03.270">And so pitiful a weakling."</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.271">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="03.272">Shook his head, his mouth drawn crooked,</l>
<l n="03.273">And he tossed his locks of blackness.</l>
<l n="03.274">And he spake the words which follow:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.275">"He who shuns the sword's decision,</l>
<l n="03.276">Nor betakes him to his sword-blade,</l>
<l n="03.277">To a swine I soon will sing him,</l>
<l n="03.278">To a snouted swine transform him.</l>
<l n="03.279">Heroes I have thus o'erpowered,</l>
<l n="03.280">Hither will I drive and thither.</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="03.281">And will pitch them on the dunghill,</l>
<l n="03.282">Grunting in the cowshed corner."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.283">Angry then was Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.284">Filled with wrath and indignation,</l>
<l n="03.285">And himself commenced his singing,</l>
<l n="03.286">And to speak his words of wisdom.</l>
<l n="03.287">But he sang no childish ditties,</l>
<l n="03.288">Children's songs and women's jesting,</l>
<l n="03.289">But a song for bearded heroes,</l>
<l n="03.290">Such as all the children sing not,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="03.291">Nor a half the boys can master,</l>
<l n="03.292">Nor a third can lovers compass,</l>
<l n="03.293">In the days of dark misfortune,</l>
<l n="03.294">When our life is near its ending.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.295">Sang the aged Väinämöinen;</l>
<l n="03.296">Lakes swelled up, and earth was shaken,</l>
<l n="03.297">And the coppery mountains trembled.</l>
<l n="03.298">And the mighty rocks resounded.</l>
<l n="03.299">And the mountains clove asunder;</l>
<l n="03.300">On the shore the stones were shivered.</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="03.301">Then he sang of Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="03.302">Changed his runners into saplings,</l>
<l n="03.303">And to willows changed the collar,</l>
<l n="03.304">And the reins he turned to alder,</l>
<l n="03.305">And he sang the sledge all gilded,</l>
<l n="03.306">To the lake among the rushes,</l>
<l n="03.307">And the whip, with beads embellished,</l>
<l n="03.308">To a reed upon the water,</l>
<l n="03.309">And the horse, with front white-spotted</l>
<l n="03.310">To a stone beside the torrent.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.311">Then he sang his sword, gold-hilted,</l>
<l n="03.312">To a lightning-flash in heaven,</l>
<l n="03.313">And his ornamented crossbow,</l>
<l n="03.314">To a rainbow o'er the water,</l>
<l n="03.315">And he sang his feathered arrows,</l>
<l n="03.316">Into hawks that soar above him;</l>
<l n="03.317">And his dog, with upturned muzzle,</l>
<l n="03.318">Stands a stone in earth embedded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.319">From his head, his cap, by singing,</l>
<l n="03.320">Next became a cloud above him,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="03.321">From his hands, his gloves, by singing,</l>
<l n="03.322">Next were changed to water-lilies,</l>
<l n="03.323">And the blue coat he was wearing,</l>
<l n="03.324">Floats a fleecy cloud in heaven,</l>
<l n="03.325">And the handsome belt that girt him,</l>
<l n="03.326">In the sky as stars he scattered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.327">As he sang, sank Joukahainen</l>
<l n="03.328">Waist-deep in the swamp beneath him,</l>
<l n="03.329">Hip-deep in the marshy meadow,</l>
<l n="03.330">To his arm-pits in a quicksand.</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="03.331">Then indeed young Joukahainen</l>
<l n="03.332">Knew at last, and comprehended;</l>
<l n="03.333">And he knew his course was finished,</l>
<l n="03.334">And his journey now was ended.</l>
<l n="03.335">For in singing he was beaten,</l>
<l n="03.336">By the aged Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.337">He would raise his foot to struggle</l>
<l n="03.338">But he could no longer lift it;</l>
<l n="03.339">Then he tried to lift the other,</l>
<l n="03.340">But as shod with stone he felt it.</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.341">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="03.342">Felt the greatest pain and anguish,</l>
<l n="03.343">And he fell in grievous trouble,</l>
<l n="03.344">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="03.345">"O thou wisest Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.346">O thou oldest of magicians,</l>
<l n="03.347">Speak thy words of magic backwards,</l>
<l n="03.348">And reverse thy songs of magic.</l>
<l n="03.349">Loose me from this place of terror,</l>
<l n="03.350">And release me from my torment.</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="03.351">I will pay the highest ransom,</l>
<l n="03.352">And the fixed reward will give thee."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.353">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.354">"What do you propose to give me,</l>
<l n="03.355">If I turn my words of magic,</l>
<l n="03.356">And reverse my songs of magic,</l>
<l n="03.357">Loose you from this place of terror,</l>
<l n="03.358">And release you from your torment?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.359">Said the youthful Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="03.360">"I've two crossbows I could give you,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="03.361">Ay, a pair of splendid crossbows,</l>
<l n="03.362">One shoots forth with passing quickness,</l>
<l n="03.363">Surely hits the mark the other.</l>
<l n="03.364">If it please you, choose between them."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.365">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="03.366">"No, your bows I do not covet,</l>
<l n="03.367">For the wretched bows I care not;</l>
<l n="03.368">I myself have plenty of them.</l>
<l n="03.369">All the walls are decked with crossbows,</l>
<l n="03.370">All the pegs are hung with crossbows;"</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="03.371">In the woods they wander hunting,</l>
<l n="03.372">Nor a hero needs to span them."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.373">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="03.374">In the swamp he sang yet deeper.</l>
<l n="03.375">Said the youthful Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="03.376">"I have yet two boats to offer;</l>
<l n="03.377">Splendid boats, as I can witness,</l>
<l n="03.378">One is light, and fit for racing,</l>
<l n="03.379">Heavy loads will bear the other;</l>
<l n="03.380">If it please you, choose between them."</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>

<l n="03.389">Then the youthful Joukahainen,</l>

<lg>
<l n="03.391">Said the youthful Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="03.392">"I have still two noble stallions;</l>
<l n="03.393">Ay, a pair of handsome horses;</l>
<l n="03.394">One of these of matchless swiftness,</l>

<l n="03.443">Then the youthful Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="03.444">Felt at length the greatest anguish,</l>
<l n="03.445">Chin-deep in the swamp while sinking,</l>
<l n="03.446">In the mud his beard was draggled,</l>
<l n="03.447">In the moss his mouth was sunken,</l>

<lg>

<l n="03.537">But when Joukahainen's sister</l>
<l n="03.538">Heard, she wept in deepest sorrow,</l>
<l n="03.539">Wept one day, and wept a second,</l>
<l n="03.540">At the threshold ever weeping,</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>

<l n="03.543">Then her mother said consoling,</l>

<l n="03.545">You have gained a valiant bridegroom,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="03.549">But her daughter heard and answered,</l>

<head>THE FATE OF AINO</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen meets Aino in the wood and addresses her (1-20). Aino hurries home weeping, and informs her mother (21-116). Her mother forbids her to weep, and tells her to rejoice, and to adorn herself handsomely (117-188). Aino continues to weep, and declares that she will never take a very old man as her husband (189-254). She wanders sorrowfully into the wild woods, and reaches the banks of a strange unknown lake, where she goes to bathe, and is lost in the water (255-370). The animals commission the hare to carry the tidings of Aino's death to her home (371-434). Her mother weeps for her night and day (435-518).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="04.001">Then the little maiden Aino,</l>
<l n="04.002">Youthful Joukahainen's sister,</l>
<l n="04.003">Went for besoms to the greenwood,</l>

<l n="04.005">One she gathered for her father,</l>
<l n="04.006">And a second for her mother,</l>

<l n="04.011">Came the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="04.012">And he saw her in the thicket,</l>
<l n="04.013">Finely clad among the herbage,</l>
<l n="04.014">And he spoke the words which follow.</l>
<l n="04.015">"Maiden, do not wear for others,</l>
<l n="04.016">But for me alone, O maiden,</l>
<l n="04.017">Round thy neck a beaded necklace,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN'S FISHING</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen fishes for Joukahainen's sister in the lake, and draws her into his boat in the form of a fish (1-72). He is about to cut her to pieces when she slips from his hand into the lake, and tells him who she is (73-133). Väinämöinen tries to persuade her to return to him, and then fishes for her, but in vain (134-163). He returns home disconsolate, and his dead mother advises him to woo the Maiden of Pohja (164-241).

<l n="05.015">To the blue lake's rocky margin,</l>

<l n="05.069">Nor, like water-nymphs, 'tis belted;</l>
<l n="05.070">Nor is earless like a pigeon;</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="05.071">It resembles most a salmon,</l>
<l n="05.072">Or a perch from deepest water."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.073">In his waistband Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="05.074">Bore a case-knife, silver-hafted,</l>
<l n="05.075">And he drew the knife of sharpness.</l>
<l n="05.076">Drew the case-knife, silver-hafted,</l>
<l n="05.077">And prepared to slit the salmon,</l>
<l n="05.078">And to cut the fish to pieces,</l>
<l n="05.079">Thought to eat it for his breakfast.</l>
<l n="05.080">Or a snack to make his luncheon,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="05.081">To provide him with a dinner,</l>
<l n="05.082">And a plenteous supper likewise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.083">As he would have slit the salmon.</l>
<l n="05.084">And would cut the fish to pieces,</l>
<l n="05.085">Sprang the salmon in the water,</l>
<l n="05.086">For the beauteous fish jumped sideways</l>
<l n="05.087">From the planking of the red boat,</l>
<l n="05.088">From the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.089">Thereupon her head she lifted,</l>
<l n="05.090">Raised her shoulders from the water,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="05.091">On the fifth wave's watery hillock,</l>
<l n="05.092">From the sixth high wave emerging,</l>
<l n="05.093">Then her hands in air uplifted,</l>
<l n="05.094">And displayed her left foot also,</l>
<l n="05.095">When the seventh wave roses upswelling,</l>
<l n="05.096">And upon the ninth wave's summit.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.097">Thereupon the fish addressed him,</l>
<l n="05.098">And it spoke, and thus protested:</l>
<l n="05.099">"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="05.100">Surely I have not come hither,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="05.101">Like a salmon, to be slaughtered,</l>
<l n="05.102">Or a fish, to cut to pieces,</l>
<l n="05.103">Only to become your breakfast,</l>
<l n="05.104">Or a snack to make your luncheon,</l>
<l n="05.105">To provide you with a dinner.</l>
<l n="05.106">And a plenteous supper likewise."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.107">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="05.108">"Wherefore didst thou then come hither?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.109">"Therefore 'tis that I have sought thee,</l>
<l n="05.110">In thine arm like dove to nestle,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="05.111">By thy side to sit for ever,</l>
<l n="05.112">On thy knee, as consort sitting,</l>
<l n="05.113">To prepare the couch to rest thee,</l>
<l n="05.114">And to smooth thy pillow for thee,</l>
<l n="05.115">Keep thy little room in order,</l>
<l n="05.116">And to sweep the flooring for thee,</l>
<l n="05.117">In thy room to light the fire,</l>
<l n="05.118">And to fan the flames up brightly,</l>
<l n="05.119">There large loaves of bread to bake thee,</l>
<l n="05.120">Cakes of honey to prepare thee,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="05.121">And thy jug of beer to fill thee,</l>
<l n="05.122">And thy dinner set before thee.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.123">"I am not a water-salmon,</l>
<l n="05.124">Not a perch from deepest water,</l>
<l n="05.125">But a young and lovely maiden,</l>
<l n="05.126">Youthful Joukahainen's sister,</l>
<l n="05.127">Whom thou all thy life hast longed for,</l>
<l n="05.128">Whom thou hast so long desired.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.129">"O thou pitiful old creature,</l>
<l n="05.130">Väinämöinen, void of wisdom,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="05.131">Thou hadst not the wit to hold me,</l>
<l n="05.132">Vellamo's young water-maiden,</l>
<l n="05.133">Me, the darling child of Ahto!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.134">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="05.135">Head bowed down, and deeply grieving,</l>
<l n="05.136">"Sister thou of Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="05.137">Once again return, I pray thee."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.138">But she never more came near him,</l>
<l n="05.139">Ne'er again throughout his lifetime;</l>
<l n="05.140">For she turned away, and, diving,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="05.141">Vanished from the water's surface</l>
<l n="05.142">Down among the rocks so varied,</l>
<l n="05.143">In a liver-coloured crevice.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.144">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="05.145">Pondered deeply, and reflected,</l>
<l n="05.146">What to do, and what was needful</l>
<l n="05.147">Quick he wove a net all silken,</l>
<l n="05.148">And he drew it straight and crossways,</l>
<l n="05.149">Through the reach, and then across it,</l>
<l n="05.150">Drew it through the quiet waters,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="05.151">Through the depths beloved by salmons</l>
<l n="05.152">And through Väinölä's deep waters.</l>
<l n="05.153">And by Kalevala's sharp headlands,</l>
<l n="05.154">Through the deep, dark watery caverns,</l>
<l n="05.155">And the wide expanse of water,</l>
<l n="05.156">And through Joukola's great rivers,</l>
<l n="05.157">And across the bays of Lapland.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.158">Other fish he caught in plenty,</l>
<l n="05.159">All the fishes of the waters,</l>
<l n="05.160">Only not the fish he sought for,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="05.161">Which he kept in mind for ever,</l>
<l n="05.162">Never Vellamo's fair maiden,</l>
<l n="05.163">Not the dearest child of Ahto.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.164">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="05.165">Bowed his head, lamenting deeply,</l>
<l n="05.166">With his cap adjusted sideways,</l>
<l n="05.167">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="05.168">"O how grievous is my folly,</l>
<l n="05.169">Weak am I in manly wisdom,</l>
<l n="05.170">Once indeed was understanding,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="05.171">Insight too conferred upon me,</l>
<l n="05.172">And my heart was great within me;</l>
<l n="05.173">Such in former times my portion.</l>
<l n="05.174">But in days that now are passing.</l>
<l n="05.175">In the evil days upon me,</l>
<l n="05.176">Now my strength with age is failing,</l>
<l n="05.177">All my understanding weakens</l>
<l n="05.178">And my insight has departed,</l>
<l n="05.179">All my judgment is perverted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.180">"She for whom long years I waited,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="05.181">Whom for half my life I longed for,</l>
<l n="05.182">Vellamo's fair water-maiden,</l>
<l n="05.183">Youngest daughter of the surges.</l>
<l n="05.184">Who should be my friend for ever,</l>
<l n="05.185">And my wife throughout my lifetime,</l>
<l n="05.186">Came and seized the bait I offered,</l>
<l n="05.187">In my boat sprang unresisting,</l>
<l n="05.188">But I knew not how to hold her,</l>
<l n="05.189">To my home I could not take her,</l>
<l n="05.190">But she plunged amid the waters,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="05.191">Diving to the depths profoundest."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.192">Then he wandered on a little,</l>
<l n="05.193">And he walked, in sadness sighing,</l>
<l n="05.194">To his home direct returning,</l>
<l n="05.195">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="05.196">"Once indeed the birds were singing,</l>
<l n="05.197">And my joyous cuckoo hailed me,</l>
<l n="05.198">Both at morning and at evening,</l>
<l n="05.199">Likewise, too, in midday hours.</l>
<l n="05.200">What has stilled their lively music,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="05.201">And has hushed their charming voices?</l>
<l n="05.202">Care has stilled their lively music,</l>
<l n="05.203">Sorrow checked their cheerful voices,</l>
<l n="05.204">Therefore do they sing no longer,</l>
<l n="05.205">Neither at the sun's declining,</l>
<l n="05.206">To rejoice me in the evening,</l>
<l n="05.207">Nor to cheer me in the morning.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.208">"Now no more can I consider</l>
<l n="05.209">How to shape my course of action,</l>
<l n="05.210">How upon the earth to sojourn,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="05.211">How throughout the world to travel.</l>
<l n="05.212">Would my mother now were living,</l>
<l n="05.213">And my aged mother waking!</l>
<l n="05.214">She would surely tell me truly</l>
<l n="05.215">How to best support my trouble,</l>
<l n="05.216">That my grief may not o'erwhelm me,</l>
<l n="05.217">And my sorrow may not crush me,</l>
<l n="05.218">In these weary days of evil,</l>
<l n="05.219">In this time of deep depression."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.220">In her grave his mother wakened,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="05.221">Answered from beneath the billows:</l>
<l n="05.222">"Still thy mother lives and hears thee,</l>

<l n="05.225">How to best support thy trouble.</l>
<l n="05.226">That thy grief may not o'erwhelm thee,</l>

<l n="05.232">And the maidens twice as lovely,</l>
<l n="05.233">And are five or six times nimbler,</l>
<l n="05.234">Not like lazy girls of Jouko,</l>
<l n="05.235">Lapland's fat and sluggish daughters.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="05.236">"Thence a wife, O son, provide thee,</l>
<l n="05.237">From the fairest maids of Pohja;</l>
<l n="05.238">Choose a maid of fair complexion,</l>
<l n="05.239">Lovely, too, in every feature,</l>

<head>JOUKAHAINEN'S CROSSBOW</head>
<div type="argument">Joukahainen cherishes hatred against Väinämöinen and lies in wait for him on his journey to Pohjola (1-78). He sees him riding past and shoots at him, but only kills his horse (79-182). Väinämöinen falls into the water and is driven out to sea by a tempest, while Joukahainen rejoices, because he thinks he has at last overcome Väinämöinen (183-234). 
</div>
<lg>
<l n="06.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="06.002">Now resolved upon a journey</l>
<l n="06.003">To the cold and dreary regions</l>
<l n="06.004">Of the gloomy land of Pohja.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.005">Then he took his straw-hued stallion</l>
<l n="06.006">Like a pea-stalk in his colour,</l>
<l n="06.007">And the golden bit adjusted,</l>
<l n="06.008">Bridle on his head of silver,</l>
<l n="06.009">On his back himself he seated,</l>
<l n="06.010">And he started on his journey,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="06.011">And he trotted gently onward,</l>
<l n="06.012">At an easy pace he journeyed,</l>
<l n="06.013">Mounted on the straw-hued courser,</l>
<l n="06.014">Like a pea-stalk in his colour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.015">Thus through Väinölä he journeyed,</l>
<l n="06.016">Over Kalevala's wide heathlands,</l>
<l n="06.017">And the horse made rapid progress,</l>
<l n="06.018">Home behind, and journey shortened,</l>
<l n="06.019">Then across the sea he journeyed,</l>
<l n="06.020">O'er the far-extending billows,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="06.021">With the horse's hoofs unwetted,</l>
<l n="06.022">And his feet unsunk in water.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.023">But the youthful Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="06.024">He, the puny son of Lapland,</l>
<l n="06.025">Long had cherished his resentment,</l>
<l n="06.026">And had long indeed been envious</l>
<l n="06.027">Of the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.028">Of the ever-famous minstrel</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.029">Then he wrought a mighty crossbow.</l>
<l n="06.030">And a splendid bow he fashioned,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="06.031">And he formed the bow of iron,</l>
<l n="06.032">Overlaid the back with copper.</l>
<l n="06.033">And with gold inlaid it also,</l>
<l n="06.034">And with silver he adorned it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.035">Where did he obtain the bowstring?</l>
<l n="06.036">Whence a cord to match the weapon?</l>
<l n="06.037">Sinews from the elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="06.038">And the hempen cord of Lempo.</l>
<l n="06.039">Thus at length the bow was finished.</l>
<l n="06.040">And the stock was quite completed,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="06.041">And the bow was fair to gaze on,</l>
<l n="06.042">And its value matched its beauty.</l>
<l n="06.043">At its back a horse was standing,</l>
<l n="06.044">On the stock a foal was running,</l>
<l n="06.045">On the curve a sleeping woman,</l>
<l n="06.046">At the catch a hare was couching.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.047">Shafts of wood he likewise fashioned.</l>
<l n="06.048">Every arrow triply feathered,</l>
<l n="06.049">And the shafts were formed of oakwood,</l>
<l n="06.050">And he made the heads of pinewood;"</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="06.051">Thus the arrows were completed,</l>
<l n="06.052">And he fixed the feathers on them,</l>
<l n="06.053">From the swallows' plumage taken.</l>
<l n="06.054">Likewise from the tails of sparrows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.055">After this, the points he sharpened.</l>
<l n="06.056">And the arrow-points he poisoned.</l>
<l n="06.057">In the black blood of the serpent,</l>
<l n="06.058">In the blood of hissing adders.</l>
<l n="06.059">Thus he made his arrows ready,</l>
<l n="06.060">And his bow was fit for bending,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.061">And he watched for Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.062">Waited for Suvantolainen,</l>
<l n="06.063">Watched at morning, watched at evenings</l>
<l n="06.064">Waited also through the noontide.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.065">Long he watched for Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.066">Waited long, and wearied never,</l>
<l n="06.067">Sitting gazing from the window,</l>
<l n="06.068">Or upon the stairs he waited,</l>
<l n="06.069">Sometimes lurking by the pathway,</l>
<l n="06.070">Sometimes watching in the meadow,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="06.071">On his back his well-filled quiver,</l>
<l n="06.072">'Neath his arm his crossbow ready.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.073">Then he waited further onwards.</l>
<l n="06.074">Lurking near another building,</l>
<l n="06.075">On the cape that juts out sharply,</l>
<l n="06.076">Where the tongue of land curves outward.</l>
<l n="06.077">Near a waterfall, all foaming.</l>
<l n="06.078">Past the banks of sacred rivers.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.079">And at length one day it happened.</l>
<l n="06.080">Very early in the morning,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="06.081">As he turned his eyes to westward,</l>
<l n="06.082">And he turned his head to eastward</l>
<l n="06.083">Something dark he spied on ocean.</l>
<l n="06.084">Something blue upon the billows.</l>
<l n="06.085">"Is a cloud in east arising,</l>
<l n="06.086">Or the dawn of day appearing?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.087">In the east no cloud was rising,</l>
<l n="06.088">Nor the dawn of day appearing.</l>
<l n="06.089">'Twas the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.090">'Twas the ever-famous minstrel,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="06.091">Who to Pohjola was hasting,</l>
<l n="06.092">As to Pimentola he journeyed,</l>
<l n="06.093">Mounted on his straw-hued courser.</l>
<l n="06.094">Like a pea-stalk in his colour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.095">Then the youthful Joukahainen,</l>
<l n="06.096">He, the meagre son of Lapland,</l>
<l n="06.097">Spanned in haste his mighty crossbow.</l>
<l n="06.098">And he aimed the splendid weapon</l>
<l n="06.099">At the head of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.100">Thus to kill Suvantolainen.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.101">Then his mother came and asked him,</l>
<l n="06.102">And the aged one inquired,</l>
<l n="06.103">"Wherefore do you span your weapon,</l>
<l n="06.104">Bending thus the iron crossbow?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.105">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="06.106">Answered in the words which follow.</l>
<l n="06.107">"Therefore do I span the weapon.</l>
<l n="06.108">Bending thus the iron crossbow.</l>
<l n="06.109">For the head of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.110">Thus to kill Suvantolainen,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="06.111">I will shoot old Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.112">Strike the ever-famous minstrel,</l>
<l n="06.113">Through the heart, and through the liver,</l>
<l n="06.114">'Twixt the shoulders I will shoot him."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.115">But his mother straight forbade him,</l>
<l n="06.116">And dissuaded him from shooting.</l>
<l n="06.117">"Do not shoot at Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.118">Do not Kalevalainen slaughter.</l>
<l n="06.119">Of a noble race is Väinö;</l>
<l n="06.120">He's my sister's son, my nephew.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.121">"If you shoot at Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.122">And should Kalevalainen slaughter.</l>
<l n="06.123">Gladness from the world will vanish,</l>
<l n="06.124">And from earth will song be banished.</l>
<l n="06.125">In the world is gladness better.</l>
<l n="06.126">And on earth is song more cheerful,</l>
<l n="06.127">Than to Manala if banished.</l>
<l n="06.128">And to Tuonela's darkest regions."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.129">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="06.130">Paused a moment and reflected,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="06.131">And he pondered for an instant,</l>
<l n="06.132">Though his hands to shoot were ready,</l>
<l n="06.133">One would shoot, and one restrained him,</l>
<l n="06.134">But his sinewy fingers forced him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.135">And at length these words he uttered,</l>
<l n="06.136">And expressed his own decision:</l>
<l n="06.137">"What if twice from earth in future</l>
<l n="06.138">Every gladness should be banished?</l>
<l n="06.139">Let all songs for ever vanish;</l>
<l n="06.140">I will shoot my arrows, heedless!"</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.141">Then he spanned the mighty crossbow.</l>
<l n="06.142">And he drew the bow of copper,</l>
<l n="06.143">And against his left knee bent it,</l>
<l n="06.144">Steady with his foot he held it,</l>
<l n="06.145">Took an arrow from his quiver,</l>
<l n="06.146">Chose a triple-feathered arrow,</l>
<l n="06.147">Took the strongest of his arrows,</l>
<l n="06.148">Chose the very best among them,</l>
<l n="06.149">Then upon the groove he laid it,</l>
<l n="06.150">On the hempen cord he fixed it,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="06.151">Then his mighty bow he lifted,</l>
<l n="06.152">And he placed it to his shoulder,</l>
<l n="06.153">Ready now to shoot the arrow,</l>
<l n="06.154">And to shoot at Väinämöinen.</l>
<l n="06.155">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="06.156">"Do thou strike, O birchwood arrow,</l>
<l n="06.157">Strike thou in the back, O pinewood.</l>
<l n="06.158">Twang thy best, O hempen bowstring!</l>
<l n="06.159">If my hand is leaning downward,</l>
<l n="06.160">Let the arrow then strike higher,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="06.161">If my hand is bending upward,</l>
<l n="06.162">Let the arrow then strike downward!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.163">Quickly then he drew the trigger,</l>
<l n="06.164">Shot the first among his arrows.</l>
<l n="06.165">Far too high the shaft flew upward.</l>
<l n="06.166">High above his head to skyward,</l>
<l n="06.167">And it whizzed among the cloudlets,</l>
<l n="06.168">Through the scattered clouds it wandered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.169">Thus he shot, in reckless fashion,</l>
<l n="06.170">Shot the second of his arrows.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="06.171">Far too low the shot flew downwards.</l>
<l n="06.172">Deep in Mother Earth 'twas sunken.</l>
<l n="06.173">Earth was almost sunk to Mana,</l>
<l n="06.174">And the hills of sand were cloven.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.175">Then he shot again, a third time,</l>
<l n="06.176">And the third shaft, straighter flying,</l>
<l n="06.177">In the blue elk's spleen was buried,</l>
<l n="06.178">Under aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.179">Thus he shot the straw-hued courser,</l>
<l n="06.180">Like a pea-stalk in his colour;"</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="06.181">Through the flesh beneath his shoulder,</l>
<l n="06.182">In the left side deep he pierced him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.183">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.184">Plunged his fingers in the water,</l>
<l n="06.185">With his hands the waves he parted,</l>
<l n="06.186">Grasping at the foaming billows,</l>
<l n="06.187">From the blue elk's back he tumbled</l>
<l n="06.188">From the steed of pea-stalk colour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.189">Then a mighty wind arising</l>
<l n="06.190">Raised upon the sea a billow,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="06.191">And it bore old Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.192">Swimming from the mainland further,</l>

<l n="06.194">Out into the open ocean.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.195">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="06.196">Uttered words of boastful triumph:</l>
<l n="06.197">"Now thou ancient Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.198">Never while thy life endureth,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.211">Then the house again he entered,</l>
<l n="06.212">And at once his mother asked him,</l>
<l n="06.213">"Have you shot at Väinämöinen?</l>
<l n="06.214">Slaughtered Kaleva's famous offspring?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.215">Then the youthful Joukahainen</l>
<l n="06.216">Answered in the words which follow</l>
<l n="06.217">"I have shot at Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="06.218">And have o'erthrown Kalevalainen,</l>
<l n="06.219">Sent him swimming in the water,</l>
<l n="06.220">Swept him out upon the billows,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="06.221">On the restless waves of ocean</l>
<l n="06.222">Where the waves are wildly tossing,</l>
<l n="06.223">And the old man plunged his fingers</l>
<l n="06.224">And his palms amid the waters,</l>
<l n="06.225">Then upon his side he tumbled,</l>
<l n="06.226">And upon his back he turned him,</l>
<l n="06.227">Drifting o'er the waves of ocean,</l>
<l n="06.228">Out upon the foaming billows."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="06.229">But his mother made him answer,</l>

<l n="06.231">Thus to shoot at Väinämöinen</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN AND LOUHI</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen swims for several days on the open sea (1-88). The eagle, grateful to him for having spared the birch-tree for him to rest on, when he was felling the trees takes Väinämöinen on his wings, and carries him to the borders of Pohjola, where the Mistress of Pohjola takes him to her abode, and receives him hospitably (89-274). Väinämöinen desires to return to his own country, and the Mistress of Pohjola permits him to depart, and promises him her daughter in marriage if he will forge the Sampo in Pohjola (275-322). Väinämöinen promises that when he returns home he will send the smith Ilmarinen to forge the Sampo, and the Mistress of Pohjola gives him a horse and a sledge to convey him home (323-368).

<l n="07.051">Slowly back and forwards flying,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="07.057">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="07.058">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

<l n="07.067">Where is Luotola's deep embayment,</l>
<l n="07.068">Hard by Joukola's rapid river,</l>
<l n="07.069">When my horse was shot beneath me,</l>
<l n="07.070">By an arrow launched against me.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>

<l n="07.089">Said the bird of air, the eagle,</l>

<l n="07.091">Climb upon my back, and seat thee,</l>

<l n="07.108">On the wing-tips of the eagle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="07.109">Then the bird of air, the eagle,</l>
<l n="07.110">Raised the aged Väinämöinen,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="07.111">Through the path of wind he bore him,</l>

<l n="07.114">Onwards to the misty Sariola,</l>
<l n="07.115">There abandoned Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="07.116">Soared into the air, and left him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="07.117">There stood Väinämöinen weeping,</l>
<l n="07.118">There stood weeping and lamenting,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="07.125">Thus he wept for two, and three nights,</l>

<l n="07.127">For the country round he knew not,</l>

<l n="07.133">But the little maid of Pohja,</l>
<l n="07.134">Fair-haired damsel of the household,</l>
<l n="07.135">With the sun had made agreement,</l>

<l n="07.261">Every birch-tree seems to flog me,</l>

<lg>
<l n="07.339">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN'S WOUND</head>
<div type="argument">On his journey Väinämöinen encounters the magnificently-clad Maiden of Pohja, and makes advances to her (1-50). The maiden at length consents to his wishes if he will make a boat from the splinters of her spindle, and move it into the water without touching it (51-132). Väinämöinen sets to work, but wounds his knee severely with his axe, and cannot stanch the flow of blood (133-204). He goes in search of some magic remedy and finds an old man who promises to stop the bleeding (205-282).

<l n="08.001">Lovely was the maid of Pohja,</l>

<lg>
<l n="08.011">From her hand flew swift the shuttle,</l>

<l n="08.015">As the maiden wove the fabric,</l>
<l n="08.016">And with silver interwove it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.017">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="08.018">Thundered on upon his journey,</l>

<l n="08.021">Short the distance he had travelled,</l>

<l n="08.024">High above his head he heard it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.025">Thereupon his head he lifted,</l>

<l n="08.028">On the arch the maiden seated</l>
<l n="08.029">As she wove a golden fabric.</l>
<l n="08.030">As the silver comb resounded.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.031">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="08.032">Stayed his horse upon the instant.</l>

<l n="08.034">In such words as these addressed her:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.037">Then the maiden made him answer,</l>
<l n="08.038">And in words like these responded:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.041">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast.</l>
<l n="08.042">Heard her words, and then responded:</l>

<l n="08.045">Bread of honey to prepare me,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.051">Then the maiden gave him answer,</l>
<l n="08.052">And in words like these addressed him:</l>

<l n="08.054">Tripping o'er the yellow meadows,</l>
<l n="08.055">Yesterday, in time of evening,</l>
<l n="08.056">As the sun was slowly sinking,</l>
<l n="08.057">In the bush a bird was singing,</l>
<l n="08.058">And I heard the fieldfare trilling,</l>

<l n="08.061">"Thus the bird was speaking to me,</l>

<l n="08.068">Or in household of a husband?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.069">"Thereupon the bird made answer,</l>

<l n="08.075">In her father's house a maiden</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.081">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="08.082">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="08.083">"Song of birds is idle chatter,</l>
<l n="08.084">And the throstle's, merely chirping;</l>
<l n="08.085">As a child a daughter's treated,</l>

<l n="08.166">He, the oldest of magicians,</l>
<l n="08.167">Uttered words like those which follow,</l>
<l n="08.168">And expressed himself in this wise:</l>
<l n="08.169">"O thou evil axe ferocious,</l>
<l n="08.170">With thy edge of gleaming sharpness,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="08.171">Thou hast thought to hew a tree-trunk,</l>
<l n="08.172">And to strike upon a pine-tree,</l>
<l n="08.173">Match thyself against a fir-tree,</l>
<l n="08.174">Or to fall upon a birch-tree.</l>
<l n="08.175">'Tis my flesh that thou hast wounded,</l>
<l n="08.176">And my veins thou hast divided."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.177">Then his magic spells he uttered,</l>
<l n="08.178">And himself began to speak them,</l>
<l n="08.179">Spells of origin, for healing,</l>
<l n="08.180">And to close the wound completely.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="08.181">But he could not think of any</l>
<l n="08.182">Words of origin of iron,</l>
<l n="08.183">Which might serve to bind the evil,</l>
<l n="08.184">And to close the gaping edges</l>
<l n="08.185">Of the great wound from the iron,</l>
<l n="08.186">By the blue edge deeply bitten.</l>
<l n="08.187">But the blood gushed forth in torrents,</l>
<l n="08.188">Rushing like a foaming river,</l>
<l n="08.189">O'er the berry-bearing bushes,</l>
<l n="08.190">And the heath the ground that covered.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="08.191">There remained no single hillock,</l>
<l n="08.192">Which was not completely flooded</l>
<l n="08.193">By the overflowing bloodstream,</l>
<l n="08.194">Which came rushing forth in torrents</l>
<l n="08.195">From the knee of one most worthy,</l>
<l n="08.196">From the toes of Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.197">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="08.198">Gathered from the rocks the lichen,</l>
<l n="08.199">From the swamps the moss collected,</l>
<l n="08.200">Earth he gathered from the hillocks,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="08.201">Hoping thus to stop the outlet</l>
<l n="08.202">Of the wound that bled so freely,</l>
<l n="08.203">But he could not check the bleeding,</l>
<l n="08.204">Nor restrain it in the slightest.</l>
<l n="08.205">And the pain he felt oppressed him,</l>
<l n="08.206">And the greatest trouble seized him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.207">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="08.208">Then began to weep full sorely.</l>
<l n="08.209">Thereupon his horse he harnessed,</l>
<l n="08.210">In the sledge he yoked the chestnut,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="08.211">On the sledge himself he mounted,</l>
<l n="08.212">And upon the seat he sat him.</l>
<l n="08.213">O'er the horse his whip he brandished,</l>
<l n="08.214">With the bead-decked whip he lashed him.</l>
<l n="08.215">And the horse sped quickly onward.</l>
<l n="08.216">Rocked the sledge, the way grew shorter,</l>
<l n="08.217">And they quickly reached a village,</l>
<l n="08.218">Where the path in three divided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="08.219">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

<head>THE ORIGIN OF IRON</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen repeats to the old man the legend of the origin of iron (1-266). The old man reviles the iron and repeats spells for the stopping of blood, and the flow of blood is stayed (267-416). The old man directs his son to prepare a salve, and dresses and binds up the wound. Väinämöinen is cured, and thanks Jumala for his merciful assistance (417-586).

<l n="09.001">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="09.002">In the sledge at once stood upright,</l>
<l n="09.003">From the sledge he sprang unaided,</l>
<l n="09.004">And courageously stood upright.</l>
<l n="09.005">To the room he hastened quickly,</l>
<l n="09.006">And beneath the roof he hurried.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.007">There they brought a silver beaker,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.025">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="09.026">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="09.027">"Well I know the birth of Iron,</l>

<l n="09.029">Air is the primeval mother,</l>
<l n="09.030">Water is the eldest brother,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.039">"Ukko, God of realms supernal,</l>
<l n="09.040">Rubbed his mighty hands together.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="09.041">Both his hands he rubbed together,</l>
<l n="09.042">On his left knee then he pressed them,</l>
<l n="09.043">And three maidens were created,</l>
<l n="09.044">Three fair Daughters of Creation,</l>

<l n="09.047">"Strolled the maids with faltering footsteps</l>
<l n="09.048">On the borders of the cloudlets,</l>
<l n="09.049">And their full breasts were o'erflowing,</l>
<l n="09.050">And their nipples pained them sorely.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="09.051">Down on earth their milk ran over,</l>

<lg>
<l n="09.055">"Black milk from the first was flowing,</l>

<l n="09.057">White milk issued from another,</l>
<l n="09.058">From the second of the maidens,</l>
<l n="09.059">Red milk by the third was yielded,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.061">"Where the black milk had been dropping,</l>
<l n="09.062">There was found the softest Iron,</l>

<l n="09.065">Where the red milk had been trickling,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.067">"But a short time had passed over,</l>
<l n="09.068">When the Iron desired to visit</l>
<l n="09.069">Him, its dearest elder brother,</l>
<l n="09.070">And to make the Fire's acquaintance.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.071">"But the Fire arose in fury,</l>
<l n="09.072">Blazing up in greatest anger,</l>

<l n="09.074">E'en the wretched Iron, its brother.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.075">"Then the Iron sought out a refuge,</l>
<l n="09.076">Sought for refuge and protection</l>
<l n="09.077">From the hands of furious Fire,</l>
<l n="09.078">From his mouth, all bright with anger.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.079">"Then the Iron took refuge from him,</l>
<l n="09.080">Sought both refuge and protection</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="09.081">Down amid the quaking marshes,</l>
<l n="09.082">Where the springs have many sources,</l>
<l n="09.083">On the level mighty marshes,</l>
<l n="09.084">On the void and barren mountains,</l>
<l n="09.085">Where the swans their eggs deposit,</l>
<l n="09.086">And the goose her brood is rearing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.087">"In the swamps lay hid the Iron,</l>
<l n="09.088">Stretched beneath the marshy surface,</l>
<l n="09.089">Hid for one year and a second,</l>
<l n="09.090">For a third year likewise hidden,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="09.091">Hidden there between two tree-stumps,</l>
<l n="09.092">'Neath three roots of birch-trees hidden</l>
<l n="09.093">But it had not yet found safety</l>
<l n="09.094">From the fierce hands of the Fire,</l>

<l n="09.096">To the dwelling of the Fire,</l>
<l n="09.097">That it should be forged to weapons,</l>
<l n="09.098">And to sword-blades should be fashioned.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.099">"On the marshes wolves were running,</l>
<l n="09.100">On the heath the bears came trooping.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="09.101">'Neath the wolves' feet quaked the marshes,</l>
<l n="09.102">'Neath the bears the heath was shaken,</l>
<l n="09.103">Thus was ore of iron uncovered,</l>

<l n="09.106">And the paws of bears had trampled.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.107">"Then was born smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="09.108">Thus was born, and thus was nurtured,</l>
<l n="09.109">Born upon a hill of charcoal,</l>

<l n="09.113">"Ilmari was born at night-time,</l>
<l n="09.114">And at day he built his smithy,</l>
<l n="09.115">Sought a place to build his smithy,</l>
<l n="09.116">Where he could construct his bellows,</l>
<l n="09.117">In the swamp he found a land-ridge,</l>
<l n="09.118">And a small place in the marshes,</l>
<l n="09.119">So he went to gaze upon it,</l>
<l n="09.120">And examined the surroundings,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="09.121">And erected there his bellows,</l>
<l n="09.122">And his anvil there constructed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.123">"Then he hastened to the wolf-tracks,</l>
<l n="09.124">And the bear-tracks also followed,</l>

<l n="09.127">In the wolves' enormous footprints;</l>
<l n="09.128">Where the bears' paws left their imprints.</l>
<l n="09.129">Then he spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="09.131">In an ill abode thou dwellest,</l>
<l n="09.132">In a very lowly station,</l>

<l n="09.134">And the imprints of the bear-paws.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.135">"Then he pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="09.136">'What would be the upshot of it,</l>
<l n="09.137">If I cast it in the fire,</l>
<l n="09.138">And I laid it on the anvil?'</l>

<lg>
<l n="09.139">"Sore alarmed was hapless Iron,</l>
<l n="09.140">Sore alarmed, and greatly startled,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="09.141">When of Fire it heard him speaking,</l>
<l n="09.142">Speaking of the furious Fire.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.143">"Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="09.144">'But indeed it cannot happen;</l>

<lg>
<l n="09.153">"Therefore when the day was ended,</l>
<l n="09.154">Was the Iron from out the marshes,</l>
<l n="09.155">Delved from all the swampy places,</l>
<l n="09.156">Carried homeward to the smithy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.157">"Then he cast it in the furnace,</l>
<l n="09.158">And he laid it on the anvil,</l>
<l n="09.159">Blew a blast, and then a second,</l>
<l n="09.160">And he blew again a third time,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="09.161">Till the Iron was fully softened,</l>

<lg>
<l n="09.167">"Then exclaimed the Iron unhappy,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.177">"Therefore swore the Iron unhappy,</l>

<l n="09.180">By the hammer and the mallet,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="09.181">And it said the words which follow,</l>

<l n="09.193">"Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>

<l n="09.463">Took the pot from off the furnace,</l>

<l n="09.526">To the topmost Mount of Suffering,</l>
<l n="09.527">There to fill the stones with anguish,</l>
<l n="09.528">And the slabs of rock to torture.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.529">Then he took a silken fabric,</l>
<l n="09.530">And in strips he quickly cut it;</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
<l n="09.531">From the edge he tore the fragments,</l>
<l n="09.532">And at once he formed a bandage;</l>
<l n="09.533">Then he took the silken bandage,</l>
<l n="09.534">And with utmost care he wound it,</l>
<l n="09.535">Round the knees he wound it deftly,</l>
<l n="09.536">Round the toes of Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.537">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="09.538">And expressed himself in this wise:</l>
<l n="09.539">"Thus I use God's silken bandage,</l>
<l n="09.540">The Creator's mantle wind I"</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
<l n="09.541">Round the great knees of the patient,</l>
<l n="09.542">Round the toes of one most noble.</l>
<l n="09.543">Watch thou, Jumala most gracious,</l>
<l n="09.544">Give thy aid, O great Creator,</l>
<l n="09.545">That we fall not in misfortune,</l>
<l n="09.546">That no evil may o'ertake us."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.547">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="09.548">Felt he had regained his vigour,</l>
<l n="09.549">And that he was healed completely,</l>
<l n="09.550">And his flesh again was solid,</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
<l n="09.551">And beneath it all was healthy.</l>
<l n="09.552">In his body he was painless,</l>
<l n="09.553">And his sides were quite uninjured,</l>
<l n="09.554">From above the wounds had vanished,</l>
<l n="09.555">Stronger felt he than aforetime,</l>
<l n="09.556">Better than in former seasons.</l>
<l n="09.557">On his feet he now was walking</l>
<l n="09.558">And could bend his knees in stamping;</l>
<l n="09.559">Not the least of pain he suffered,</l>
<l n="09.560">Not a trace remained of aching.</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.561">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="09.562">Lifted up his eyes to heaven,</l>
<l n="09.563">Gazing up to God most gracious,</l>
<l n="09.564">Lifting up his head to heaven,</l>
<l n="09.565">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="09.566">And expressed himself in this wise:</l>
<l n="09.567">"Thence all mercy flows for ever,</l>
<l n="09.568">Thence comes aid the most effective,</l>
<l n="09.569">From the heaven that arches o'er us,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.571">"Praise to Jumala most gracious,</l>
<l n="09.572">Praise to thee, O great Creator,</l>
<l n="09.573">That thy aid thou hast vouchsafed me,</l>
<l n="09.574">Granted me thy strong protection,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="09.577">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="09.578">Further spoke these words of warning:</l>
<l n="09.579">"People, henceforth in the future</l>

<l n="09.581">Make no boat in mood of boasting,</l>
<l n="09.582">Nor confide too much in boat-ribs.</l>
<l n="09.583">God foresees the course of by-ways,</l>
<l n="09.584">The Creator orders all things;</l>
<l n="09.585">Not the foresight of the heroes,</l>
<l n="09.586">Nor the might of all the great ones."</l>

<head>THE FORGING OF THE SAMPO</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen reaches home and urges Ilmarinen to depart to woo the Maiden of Pohja, because he would be able to forge a Sampo (1-100). Ilmarinen refuses to go to Pohjola, but Väinämöinen conveys him thither without his consent by a stratagem (101-200). Ilmarinen arrives in Pohjola, where he is very well received, and promises to forge a Sampo (201-280). He forges the Sampo, and the Mistress of Pohjola conceals it in the Rocky Mountain of Pohjola (281-432). Ilmarinen asks for the maiden as his reward, but she makes excuses, saying that she is not yet ready to leave home (433-462). Ilmarinen receives a boat, returns home, and informs Väinämöinen that he has forged the Sampo in Pohjola (463-510).

<lg>
<l n="10.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="10.002">Took his horse of chestnut colour,</l>
<l n="10.003">And between the shafts he yoked him,</l>
<l n="10.004">Yoked before the sledge the chestnut,</l>
<l n="10.005">On the sledge himself he mounted,</l>
<l n="10.006">And upon the seat he sat him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.007">Quickly then his whip he flourished,</l>
<l n="10.008">Cracked his whip, all bead-embroidered,</l>
<l n="10.009">Quick he sped upon his journey,</l>
<l n="10.010">Lurched the sledge, the way was shortened,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="10.011">Loudly rang the birchwood runners,</l>
<l n="10.012">And the rowan cumber rattled.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.013">On he rushed with speed tremendous,</l>
<l n="10.014">Through the swamps and open country,</l>
<l n="10.015">O'er the heaths, so wide extending.</l>
<l n="10.016">Thus he drove a day, a second,</l>
<l n="10.017">And at length, upon the third day,</l>
<l n="10.018">Reached the long bridge-end before him</l>
<l n="10.019">Kalevala's extended heathlands,</l>
<l n="10.020">Bordering on the field of Osmo.</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.021">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.031">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="10.032">Spoke aloud his songs of magic,</l>
<l n="10.033">And a flower-crowned birch grew upward,</l>
<l n="10.034">Crowned with flowers, and leaves all golden,</l>
<l n="10.035">And its summit reached to heaven,</l>
<l n="10.036">To the very clouds uprising.</l>
<l n="10.037">In the air the boughs extended,</l>
<l n="10.038">And they spread themselves to heaven.</l>

<l n="10.039">Then he sang his songs of magic,</l>

<l n="10.041">On the pine-tree's golden summit;</l>
<l n="10.042">And the Great Bear in the branches.</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.043">On he drove with speed tremendous,</l>
<l n="10.044">Straight to his beloved homestead,</l>
<l n="10.045">Head bowed down, and thoughts all gloomy,</l>
<l n="10.046">And his cap was tilted sideways,</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.053">Presently his horse he halted</l>

<l n="10.055">And the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="10.056">In the sledge his head uplifted,</l>
<l n="10.057">Heard the noise within the smithy,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.059">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="10.060">Then himself the smithy entered,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>

<lg>
<l n="10.067">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.075">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.076">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

<l n="10.113">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="10.114">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="10.115">"There is wonder after wonder;</l>
<l n="10.116">There's a pine with flowery summit,</l>

<l n="10.125">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<l n="10.127">We will go ourselves, and witness</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.129">Then they both went forth to see it,</l>

<l n="10.131">First walked aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.139">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="10.140">Spoke the very words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>

<l n="10.150">On the pine-tree's golden summit.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.151">Said the pine-tree's golden summit,</l>
<l n="10.152">Said the widely-branching pine-tree,</l>
<l n="10.153">"Mighty man, of all most foolish,</l>
<l n="10.154">O most thoughtless of the heroes!</l>
<l n="10.155">In my branches, fool, thou climbest,</l>

<l n="10.158">And the false stars thou beholdest!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.159">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="10.160">Lifted up his voice in singing.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="10.161">As he sang uprose a tempest,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.169">Then there rose a mighty tempest,</l>
<l n="10.170">And the wind so wildly furious</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="10.171">Carried off smith Ilmarinen,</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.185">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="10.186">Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
<l n="10.187">In the house she stood and listened,</l>
<l n="10.188">And at length she spoke as follows:</l>

<l n="10.191">On the tempest-path who comest,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.195">Said the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.196">"Surely I have not come hither</l>
<l n="10.197">That the village dogs should shame me,</l>

<l n="10.249">Gold was shining on her bosom,</l>
<l n="10.250">On her head was silver gleaming.</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.251">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="10.252">Lead the smith named Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.253">Into Pohjola's great castle.</l>
<l n="10.254">Rooms of Sariola the gloomy.</l>
<l n="10.255">There she set a meal before him,</l>
<l n="10.256">Gave the hero drink in plenty,</l>
<l n="10.257">And she feasted him profusely,</l>
<l n="10.258">And at length she spoke as follows:</l>
<l n="10.259">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.260">Thou the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="10.261">If you can but forge a Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.262">With its many-coloured cover,</l>
<l n="10.263">From the tips of swans' white wing-plumes,</l>
<l n="10.264">From the milk of barren heifer,</l>
<l n="10.265">From a little grain of barley,</l>
<l n="10.266">From the wool of sheep of summer,</l>
<l n="10.267">Will you then accept this maiden,</l>
<l n="10.268">As reward, my charming daughter?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.269">Then the smith named Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.270">Answered in the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="10.271">"I will go to forge the Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.272">Weld its many-coloured cover,</l>
<l n="10.273">From the tips of swans' white wing-plumes,</l>
<l n="10.274">From the milk of barren heifer,</l>
<l n="10.275">From a little grain of barley,</l>
<l n="10.276">From the wool of sheep of summer,</l>
<l n="10.277">For 'twas I who forged the heavens,</l>
<l n="10.278">And the vault of air I hammered,</l>
<l n="10.279">Ere the air had yet beginning,</l>
<l n="10.280">Or a trace of aught was present."</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.281">Then he went to forge the Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.282">With its many-coloured cover,</l>
<l n="10.283">Sought a station for a smithy,</l>
<l n="10.284">And he needed tools for labour;</l>
<l n="10.285">But no place he found for smithy,</l>
<l n="10.286">Nor for smithy, nor for bellows,</l>
<l n="10.287">Nor for furnace, nor for anvil,</l>
<l n="10.288">Not a hammer, nor a mallet.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.289">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.290">Spoke aloud the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="10.291">"None despair, except old women,</l>
<l n="10.292">Scamps may leave their task unfinished;</l>
<l n="10.293">Not a man, how weak soever,</l>
<l n="10.294">Not a hero of the laziest!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.295">For his forge he sought a station,</l>
<l n="10.296">And a wide place for the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.297">In the country round about him,</l>
<l n="10.298">In the outer fields of Pohja.</l>
<l n="10.299">So he sought one day, a second,</l>
<l n="10.300">And at length upon the third day</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="10.301">Found a stone all streaked with colours,</l>
<l n="10.302">And a mighty rock beside it.</l>
<l n="10.303">Here the smith his search abandoned,</l>
<l n="10.304">And the smith prepared his furnace,</l>
<l n="10.305">On the first day fixed the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.306">And the forge upon the second.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.307">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.308">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="10.309">Heaped the fuel upon the fire,</l>
<l n="10.310">And beneath the forge he thrust it,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="10.311">Made his servants work the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.312">To the half of all their power.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.313">So the servants worked the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.314">To the half of all their power.</l>
<l n="10.315">During three days of the summer,</l>
<l n="10.316">During three nights of the summer.</l>
<l n="10.317">Stones beneath their heels were resting,</l>
<l n="10.318">And upon their toes were boulders.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.319">On the first day of their labour</l>
<l n="10.320">He himself, smith Ilmarinen,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="10.321">Stooped him down, intently gazing,</l>
<l n="10.322">To the bottom of the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.323">If perchance amid the fire</l>
<l n="10.324">Something brilliant had developed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.325">From the flames there rose a crossbow,</l>
<l n="10.326">Golden bow from out the furnace;</l>
<l n="10.327">'Twas a gold bow tipped with silver,</l>
<l n="10.328">And the shaft shone bright with copper.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.329">And the bow was fair to gaze on,</l>
<l n="10.330">But of evil disposition,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="10.331">And a head each day demanded,</l>
<l n="10.332">And on feast-days two demanded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.333">He himself, smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.334">Was not much delighted with it,</l>
<l n="10.335">So he broke the bow to pieces,</l>
<l n="10.336">Cast it back into the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.337">Made his servants work the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.338">To the half of all their power.</l>
<l n="10.339">So again upon the next day,</l>
<l n="10.340">He himself, smith Ilmarinen,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="10.341">Stooped him down, intently gazing</l>
<l n="10.342">To the bottom of the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.343">And a boat rose from the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.344">From the heat rose up a red boat,</l>
<l n="10.345">And the prow was golden-coloured,</l>
<l n="10.346">And the rowlocks were of copper.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.347">And the boat was fair to gaze on,</l>
<l n="10.348">But of evil disposition;</l>
<l n="10.349">It would go to needless combat,</l>
<l n="10.350">And would fight when cause was lacking.</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.351">Therefore did smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.352">Take no slightest pleasure in it,</l>
<l n="10.353">And he smashed the boat to splinters,</l>
<l n="10.354">Cast it back into the furnace;</l>
<l n="10.355">Made his servants work the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.356">To the half of all their power.</l>
<l n="10.357">Then upon the third day likewise,</l>
<l n="10.358">He himself, smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.359">Stooped him down, intently gazing</l>
<l n="10.360">To the bottom of the furnace,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="10.361">And a heifer then rose upward,</l>
<l n="10.362">With her horns all golden-shining,</l>
<l n="10.363">With the Bear-stars on her forehead;</l>
<l n="10.364">On her head appeared the Sun-disc.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.365">And the cow was fair to gaze on,</l>
<l n="10.366">But of evil disposition;</l>
<l n="10.367">Always sleeping in the forest,</l>
<l n="10.368">On the ground her milk she wasted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.369">Therefore did smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.370">Take no slightest pleasure in her,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="10.371">And he cut the cow to fragments,</l>
<l n="10.372">Cast her back into the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.373">Made his servants work the bellows,</l>
<l n="10.374">To the half of all their power.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.375">So again upon the fourth day,</l>
<l n="10.376">He himself, smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.377">Stooped him down, and gazed intently</l>
<l n="10.378">To the bottom of the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.379">And a plough rose from the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.380">With the ploughshare golden-shining,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="10.381">Golden share, and frame of copper,</l>
<l n="10.382">And the handles tipped with silver.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.383">And the plough was fair to gaze on,</l>
<l n="10.384">But of evil disposition,</l>
<l n="10.385">Ploughing up the village corn fields,</l>
<l n="10.386">Ploughing up the open meadows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.387">Therefore did smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.388">Take no slightest pleasure in it.</l>
<l n="10.389">And he broke the plough to pieces,</l>
<l n="10.390">Cast it back into the furnace,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="10.391">Call the winds to work the bellows</l>
<l n="10.392">To the utmost of their power.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.393">Then the winds arose in fury,</l>
<l n="10.394">Blew the east wind, blew the west wind,</l>
<l n="10.395">And the south wind yet more strongly,</l>
<l n="10.396">And the north wind howled and blustered.</l>
<l n="10.397">Thus they blew one day, a second,</l>
<l n="10.398">And upon the third day likewise.</l>
<l n="10.399">Fire was flashing from the windows,</l>
<l n="10.400">From the door the sparks were flying</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
<l n="10.401">And the dust arose to heaven;</l>
<l n="10.402">With the clouds the smoke was mingled.</l>
<l n="10.403">Then again smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.404">On the evening of the third day,</l>
<l n="10.405">Stooped him down, and gazed intently</l>
<l n="10.406">To the bottom of the furnace,</l>
<l n="10.407">And he saw the Sampo forming,</l>
<l n="10.408">With its many-coloured cover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.409">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.410">He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
<l n="10.411">Welded it and hammered at it,</l>
<l n="10.412">Heaped his rapid blows upon it,</l>
<l n="10.413">Forged with cunning art the Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.414">And on one side was a corn-mill,</l>
<l n="10.415">On another side a salt-mill,</l>
<l n="10.416">And upon the third a coin-mill.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.417">Now was grinding the new Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.418">And revolved the pictured cover,</l>
<l n="10.419">Chestfuls did it grind till evening,</l>
<l n="10.420">First for food it ground a chestful,</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
<l n="10.421">And another ground for barter,</l>
<l n="10.422">And a third it ground for storage.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.423">Now rejoiced the Crone of Pohja,</l>
<l n="10.424">And conveyed the bulky Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.425">To the rocky hills of Pohja,</l>
<l n="10.426">And within the Mount of Copper,</l>
<l n="10.427">And behind nine locks secured it.</l>
<l n="10.428">There it struck its roots around it,</l>
<l n="10.429">Fathoms nine in depth that measured,</l>
<l n="10.430">One in Mother Earth deep-rooted,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
<l n="10.431">In the strand the next was planted,</l>
<l n="10.432">In the nearest mount the third one.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.433">Afterwards smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.434">Asked the maiden as his guerdon,</l>
<l n="10.435">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="10.436">"Will you give me now the maiden,</l>
<l n="10.437">For the Sampo is completed,</l>
<l n="10.438">With its beauteous pictured cover?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.439">Then the lovely maid of Pohja</l>
<l n="10.440">Answered in the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
<l n="10.441">"Who in years that this shall follow,</l>
<l n="10.442">For three summers in succession,</l>
<l n="10.443">Who shall hear the cuckoo calling,</l>
<l n="10.444">And the birds all sweetly singing,</l>
<l n="10.445">If I seek a foreign country,</l>
<l n="10.446">As in foreign lands a berry?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.447">"If the dove had thus departed,</l>
<l n="10.448">And the maiden thus should wander,</l>
<l n="10.449">Strayed away the mother's darling,</l>
<l n="10.450">Likewise would the cranberries vanish,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
<l n="10.451">All the cuckoos vanish with them,</l>
<l n="10.452">And the nightingales would migrate,</l>
<l n="10.453">From the summit of this mountain,</l>
<l n="10.454">From the summits of these uplands.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.455">"Not as yet can I abandon</l>
<l n="10.456">My delightful life as maiden,</l>
<l n="10.457">And my innocent employments</l>
<l n="10.458">In the glowing heat of summer.</l>
<l n="10.459">All unplucked the mountain-berries,</l>
<l n="10.460">And the lakeshore will be songless,</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
<l n="10.461">And unvisited the meadows,</l>
<l n="10.462">And in woods I sport no longer."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.463">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.464">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="10.465">Sad, and with his head down-hanging,</l>
<l n="10.466">And his cap in grief thrust sideways,</l>
<l n="10.467">Presently began to ponder,</l>
<l n="10.468">In his head long time debating</l>
<l n="10.469">How he now should journey homeward,</l>
<l n="10.470">To his own familiar country,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
<l n="10.471">From the gloomy land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="10.472">Sariola for ever misty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.473">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="10.474">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.475">Wherefore is thy mind so saddened,</l>
<l n="10.476">And thy cap in grief pushed sideways?</l>
<l n="10.477">Are you thinking how to journey,</l>
<l n="10.478">Homeward to your native country?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.479">Said the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.480">"Yes, my thoughts are there directed</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="10.481">To my home that I may die there,</l>
<l n="10.482">And may rest in scenes familiar."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.483">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="10.484">Set both meat and drink before him,</l>
<l n="10.485">At the boat-stern then she placed him,</l>
<l n="10.486">There to work the copper paddle.</l>
<l n="10.487">And she bade the wind blow strongly,</l>
<l n="10.488">And the north wind fiercely bluster.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.489">Thus it was smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="10.490">He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="10.491">Travelled homeward to his country,</l>
<l n="10.492">O'er the blue sea's watery surface.</l>
<l n="10.493">Thus he voyaged one day, a second,</l>
<l n="10.494">And at length upon the third day,</l>
<l n="10.495">Reached the smith his home in safety,</l>
<l n="10.496">In the land where he was nurtured.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.497">Asked the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="10.498">When he saw smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.499">"Ilmarinen, smith and brother,</l>
<l n="10.500">Thou the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="10.501">Hast thou forged a new-made Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.502">With its many-coloured cover?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.503">Then replied smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="10.504">Ready with a fitting answer,</l>
<l n="10.505">"Grinds forth meal, the new-made Sampo,</l>
<l n="10.506">And revolves the pictured cover,</l>
<l n="10.507">Chestfuls does it grind till evening,</l>
<l n="10.508">First for food it grinds a chestful,</l>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN AND KYLLIKKI</head>
<div type="argument">Lemminkainen goes to seek a wife among the noble maidens of Saari (1-110). At first they laugh at him, but afterwards become very friendly (111-156). But Kyllikki, on whose account he has come, will not listen to him, and at length, he carries her off by force, drags her into his sledge, and drives away with her (157-222). Kyllikki weeps, and especially reproaches Lemminkainen with his fondness for war, and Lemminkainen promises not to go to war if Kyllikki promises never to go to the village dances, and both swear to observe these conditions (223-314). Lemminkainen drives home, and mother rejoices in her young daughter-in-law (315-402).

<l n="11.051">Row a boat through Viro's waters,</l>
<l n="11.052">Nor will move a punt from Saari,</l>

<l n="11.055">"Nor to Ingerland I'll travel,</l>
<l n="11.056">Nor its slopes and shores will visit.</l>
<l n="11.057">There is hunger, nought but hunger,</l>
<l n="11.058">Want of trees, and want of timber,</l>
<l n="11.059">Want of water, want of wheatfields,</l>
<l n="11.060">There is even want of ryebread."</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>

<lg>
<l n="11.061">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.062">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>

<l n="11.066">With her beauteous locks unbraided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.067">But his mother would dissuade him,</l>
<l n="11.068">And the aged woman warned him:</l>
<l n="11.069">"Do not seek, my son, my darling,</l>
<l n="11.070">Thus to wed above your station.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="11.071">There are none would think you noble</l>

<lg>
<l n="11.073">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.074">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="11.075">"If my house is not as noble,</l>
<l n="11.076">Nor my race esteemed so mighty,</l>
<l n="11.077">For my handsome shape they'll choose me,</l>
<l n="11.078">For my noble form will take me."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.079">But his mother still opposed her</l>
<l n="11.080">Unto Lemminkainen's journey,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="11.081">To the mighty race of Saari,</l>
<l n="11.082">To the clan of vast possessions.</l>
<l n="11.083">"There the maidens all will scorn you,</l>
<l n="11.084">And the women ridicule you."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.085">Little heeded Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.086">And in words like these he answered:</l>
<l n="11.087">"I will check the women's laughter,</l>
<l n="11.088">And the giggling of their daughters.</l>
<l n="11.089">Sons I'll give unto their bosoms,</l>
<l n="11.090">Children in their arms to carry;"</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="11.091">Then they will no longer scorn me,</l>
<l n="11.092">Thus I'll stop their foolish jesting."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.093">Then his mother made him answer;</l>
<l n="11.094">"Woe to me, my life is wretched.</l>
<l n="11.095">If you mock the Saari women,</l>
<l n="11.096">Bring to shame the modest maidens,</l>
<l n="11.097">You will bring yourself in conflict,</l>
<l n="11.098">And a dreadful fight will follow.</l>
<l n="11.099">All the noble youths of Saari,</l>
<l n="11.100">Full a hundred skilful swordsmen,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="11.101">All shall rush on thee unhappy,</l>

<l n="11.103">Little heeded Lemminkainen</l>

<l n="11.106">And the steed he quickly harnessed,</l>
<l n="11.107">And he drove away with clatter,</l>
<l n="11.108">To the village famed of Saari,</l>
<l n="11.109">There to woo the Flower of Saari,</l>
<l n="11.110">She, the peerless maid of Saari.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.111">But the women ridiculed him,</l>
<l n="11.112">And the maidens laughed and jeered him.</l>
<l n="11.113">In the lane he drove most strangely,</l>
<l n="11.114">Strangely to the farm came driving,</l>
<l n="11.115">Turned the sledge all topsy-turvy,</l>
<l n="11.116">At the gate he overturned it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.117">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="11.118">Mouth awry, and head downsunken,</l>
<l n="11.119">While his black beard he was twisting,</l>
<l n="11.120">Spoke aloud the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="11.121">"Never aught like this I witnessed,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.125">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.126">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="11.128">On the firm ground of the island,</l>
<l n="11.129">For the sport that I will show you,</l>
<l n="11.130">And for dancing on the greensward,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="11.131">With the joyous girls of Saari,</l>
<l n="11.132">With their fair unbraided tresses?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.133">Then the Saari maidens answered,</l>
<l n="11.134">Spoke the maidens of the headland:</l>
<l n="11.135">"There is room enough in Saari,</l>
<l n="11.136">On the firm ground of the island,</l>

<l n="11.139">For the milkmaids in the meadows,</l>
<l n="11.140">And the herd-boys in their dances;</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="11.141">Very lean are Saari's children,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.143">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.144">But engaged himself as herd-boy,</l>
<l n="11.145">Passed his days among the meadows,</l>
<l n="11.146">And his nights 'mid lively maidens,</l>
<l n="11.147">Sporting with the charming maidens,</l>
<l n="11.148">Toying with their unbound tresses.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.149">Thus the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.150">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="11.151">Ended soon the women's laughter,</l>
<l n="11.152">And the joking of the maidens.</l>
<l n="11.153">There was not a single daughter,</l>
<l n="11.154">Not a maid, however modest,</l>
<l n="11.155">But he did not soon embrace her,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.157">One alone of all the maidens,</l>
<l n="11.158">Of the mighty race of Saari,</l>

<l n="11.162">Loveliest flower of all in Saari.</l>

<lg>
<l n="11.163">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.169">Kyllikki the lovely maiden</l>
<l n="11.170">Answered him in words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="11.171">"Wherefore wander here, O weakling.</l>
<l n="11.172">Racing round me like a plover,</l>

<l n="11.179">"Nought I care for such a milksop,</l>
<l n="11.180">Such a milksop, such a humbug;</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="11.181">I must have a graceful husband,</l>

<lg>
<l n="11.187">But a little time thereafter,</l>
<l n="11.188">Scarce had half a month passed over,</l>
<l n="11.189">On a certain day it happened.</l>
<l n="11.190">As was usual in the evenings,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="11.191">All the girls had met for pleasure,</l>
<l n="11.192">And the beauteous maids were dancing;</l>
<l n="11.193">In a grove near open country,</l>
<l n="11.194">On a lovely space of heathland.</l>
<l n="11.195">Kyllikki was first among them,</l>
<l n="11.196">She the far-famed Flower of Saari.</l>
<l n="11.197">Thither came the ruddy scoundrel,</l>

<l n="11.200">With the horse that he had chosen,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="11.201">Right into the green arena</l>
<l n="11.202">Where the beauteous maids were dancing.</l>
<l n="11.203">Kyllikki he seized and lifted,</l>

<l n="11.206">That upon the sledge was lying.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.207">With his whip he lashed the stallion,</l>
<l n="11.208">And he cracked the lash above him,</l>
<l n="11.209">And he started on his journey,</l>

<l n="11.211">"O ye maidens, may ye never</l>
<l n="11.212">In your lives betray the secret,</l>
<l n="11.213">Speak of how I drove among you.</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.215">"But if you will not obey me,</l>
<l n="11.216">You will fall into misfortune;</l>

<l n="11.223">Kyllikki lamented sorely,</l>
<l n="11.224">Sobbed the beauteous Flower of Saari:</l>
<l n="11.225">"Let me but depart in safety,</l>
<l n="11.226">Let the child depart in safety,</l>
<l n="11.227">Set me free to journey homeward</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.235">When she could not gain her freedom,</l>
<l n="11.236">She began to weep profusely,</l>
<l n="11.237">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="11.238">"I, poor maid, was born for nothing,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.245">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="11.246">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
<l n="11.247">"Kyllikki, my dearest heart-core,</l>

<l n="11.281">This is surely high descended,</l>

<lg>
<l n="11.289">But the maiden sighed with anguish,</l>

<l n="11.372">And in words like these expressed her:</l>

<l n="11.381">"For thy own weal thank him also;</l>
<l n="11.382">Good is won, and good brought homeward:</l>
<l n="11.383">Good decreed by the Creator,</l>
<l n="11.384">Good that's granted by his mercy.</l>
<l n="11.385">On the snow is fair the bunting,</l>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO POHJOLA</head> <div type="argument">Kyllikki forgets her oath and goes to the village, whereupon Lemminkainen is enraged and resolves to divorce her immediately, and to set forth to woo the Maiden of Pohja (1-128). His mother does her utmost to dissuade him, telling him that he will very probably be killed. Lemminkainen, who is brushing his hair, throws the brush angrily out of his hand and declares that blood shall flow from the brush if he should come to harm (129-212). He makes ready, starts on his journey, comes to Pohjola, and sings all the men out of the homestead of Pohjola; and only neglects to enchant one wicked cowherd (213-504).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="12.001">Then did Ahti Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.002">He the handsome Kaukolainen</l>
<l n="12.003">Live awhile a life of quiet</l>
<l n="12.004">With the young bride he had chosen,</l>
<l n="12.005">And he went not forth to battle,</l>
<l n="12.006">Nor went Kylli to the village.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.007">But at length one day it happened</l>
<l n="12.008">In the early morning hours,</l>
<l n="12.009">Forth went Ahti Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.010">To the place where spawn the fishes,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="12.011">And he came not home at evening,</l>
<l n="12.012">And at nightfall he returned not.</l>
<l n="12.013">Kyllikki then sought the village,</l>
<l n="12.014">There to dance with sportive maidens.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.015">Who shall now the tidings carry,</l>
<l n="12.016">Who will now convey a message?</l>
<l n="12.017">Ainikki 'twas, Ahti's sister,</l>
<l n="12.018">She it was who brought the tidings,</l>
<l n="12.019">She it was conveyed the message.</l>
<l n="12.020">"Ahti, O my dearest brother,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="12.021">Kyllikki has sought the village,</l>
<l n="12.022">Entered there the doors of strangers,</l>

<l n="12.024">Dancing with unbraided tresses."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.025">Ahti then, for ever boyish,</l>
<l n="12.026">He the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.027">Grew both sorrowful and angry,</l>
<l n="12.028">And for long was wild with fury,</l>
<l n="12.029">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="12.030">"O my mother, aged woman,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="12.031">Wash my shirt, and wash it quickly</l>
<l n="12.032">In the black snake's deadly venom,</l>
<l n="12.033">Dry it then, and dry it quickly</l>
<l n="12.034">That I may go forth to battle,</l>
<l n="12.035">And contend with youths of Pohja,</l>
<l n="12.036">And o'erthrow the youths of Lapland.</l>
<l n="12.037">Kyllikki has sought the village,</l>
<l n="12.038">Entered there the doors of strangers,</l>

<l n="12.040">With their tresses all unbraided."</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.041">Kyllikki made answer promptly,</l>
<l n="12.042">She his favoured bride responded:</l>
<l n="12.043">"Ahti, O my dearest husband,</l>
<l n="12.044">Do not now depart to battle!</l>
<l n="12.045">I beheld while I was sleeping,</l>
<l n="12.046">While my slumber was the deepest,</l>
<l n="12.047">From the hearth the flames were flashing,</l>
<l n="12.048">Flashing forth with dazzling brightness,</l>
<l n="12.049">Leaping up below the windows,</l>
<l n="12.050">To the furthest walls extending,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="12.051">Then throughout the house blazed fiercely,</l>
<l n="12.052">Like a cataract in its fury,</l>
<l n="12.053">O'er the surface of the flooring,</l>
<l n="12.054">And from window unto window."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.055">But the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.056">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="12.057">"Nought I trust in dreams of women,</l>
<l n="12.058">Nor rely on woman's insight.</l>
<l n="12.059">O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="12.060">Bring me here my war-shirt quickly,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="12.061">Bring me, too, my mail for battle,</l>
<l n="12.062">For my inclination leads me</l>
<l n="12.063">Hence to drink the beer of battle,</l>
<l n="12.064">And to taste the mead of combat."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.065">Then his mother spoke in answer:</l>
<l n="12.066">"O my son, my dearest Ahti,</l>
<l n="12.067">Do thou not go forth to battle!</l>
<l n="12.068">In the house is beer in plenty,</l>
<l n="12.069">In the barrels made of alder.</l>
<l n="12.070">And behind the taps of oakwood.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="12.071">It is seasoned now for drinking,</l>
<l n="12.072">And all day canst thou be singing."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.073">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.074">"But for home-brewed ale I care not,</l>
<l n="12.075">Rather would I drink stream-water,</l>
<l n="12.076">From the end of tarry rudder,</l>
<l n="12.077">And this drink were sweeter to me</l>
<l n="12.078">Than the beer in all our cellars.</l>
<l n="12.079">Bring me here my war-shirt quickly,</l>
<l n="12.080">Bring me, too, my mail for battle.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="12.081">I will seek the homes of Pohja,</l>
<l n="12.082">And o'erthrow the youths of Lapland,</l>
<l n="12.083">And for gold will ask the people,</l>
<l n="12.084">And I will demand their silver."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.085">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="12.086">"O my son, my dearest Ahti,</l>
<l n="12.087">We ourselves have gold in plenty,</l>
<l n="12.088">Silver plenty in the storeroom.</l>
<l n="12.089">Only yesterday it happened,</l>
<l n="12.090">In the early hours of morning,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="12.091">Ploughed the slave a field of vipers,</l>
<l n="12.092">Full of twining, twisting serpents,</l>
<l n="12.093">And a chest-lid raised the ploughshare,</l>
<l n="12.094">And the chest was full of money.</l>
<l n="12.095">Coins by hundreds there were hidden,</l>
<l n="12.096">Thousands there were squeezed together,</l>
<l n="12.097">To our stores the chest was carried,</l>
<l n="12.098">In the loft we stored it safely."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.099">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.100">"Nought I care for home-stored treasures.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="12.101">I will win me marks in battle,</l>
<l n="12.102">Treasures won by far are better,</l>
<l n="12.103">Than the gold in all our storerooms,</l>
<l n="12.104">Or the silver found in ploughing.</l>
<l n="12.105">Bring me here my war-shirt quickly,</l>
<l n="12.106">Bring me, too, my mail for battle,</l>
<l n="12.107">I will go to war in Pohja,</l>
<l n="12.108">To destroy the sons of Lapland.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.109">"There my inclination leads me</l>
<l n="12.110">And my understanding drives me,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="12.111">And my own ears shall inform me,</l>
<l n="12.112">And my own eyes show me truly,</l>
<l n="12.113">If in Pohjola a maiden,</l>
<l n="12.114">In Pimentola a maiden,</l>
<l n="12.115">Is not longing for a lover,</l>
<l n="12.116">For the best of men desirous."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.117">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="12.118">"O my son, my dearest Ahti,</l>
<l n="12.119">Kyllikki at home is with thee,</l>
<l n="12.120">Fairest she of all the housewives.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="12.121">Strange it were to see two women</l>
<l n="12.122">In a bed beside one husband."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.123">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.124">"Kyllikki has sought the village.</l>
<l n="12.125">Let her go to all the dances,</l>
<l n="12.126">Let her sleep in all the houses,</l>
<l n="12.127">Where the village girls are sporting,</l>
<l n="12.128">Dancing with unbraided tresses."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.129">Still his mother would dissuade him,</l>
<l n="12.130">And the aged woman warned him:</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="12.131">"Yet beware, my son, and go not</l>
<l n="12.132">Unto Pohjola's dread homestead,</l>
<l n="12.133">Destitute of magic knowledge,</l>
<l n="12.134">Destitute of all experience,</l>
<l n="12.135">There to meet the youths of Pohja,</l>
<l n="12.136">And to conquer Lapland's children!</l>
<l n="12.137">There the Laplanders will sing you,</l>
<l n="12.138">And the Turja men will thrust you,</l>
<l n="12.139">Head in clay, and mouth in charcoal,</l>
<l n="12.140">With your arms where sparks are flying,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="12.141">And your hands in glowing embers,</l>
<l n="12.142">There upon the burning hearthstones."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.143">Lemminkainen heard and answered:</l>
<l n="12.144">"Once some sorcerers would enchant me,</l>
<l n="12.145">Wizards charm, and snakes would blast me.</l>
<l n="12.146">As three Laplanders attempted</l>
<l n="12.147">Through the night in time of summer,</l>
<l n="12.148">On a rock all naked standing,</l>
<l n="12.149">Wearing neither clothes nor waistband;</l>
<l n="12.150">Not a rag was twisted round them,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="12.151">But they got what I could give them,</l>
<l n="12.152">Like the miserable codfish,</l>
<l n="12.153">Like the axe on stone that's battered,</l>
<l n="12.154">Or against the rock the auger,</l>
<l n="12.155">Or on slippery ice a sabot,</l>
<l n="12.156">Or like Death in empty houses.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.157">"Otherwise indeed they threatened,</l>
<l n="12.158">Otherwise events had happened,</l>
<l n="12.159">For they wanted to o'erthrow me,</l>
<l n="12.160">Threatened they would sink me deeply</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="12.161">In the swamp when I was walking,</l>
<l n="12.162">That in mire I might be sunken,</l>
<l n="12.163">In the mud my chin pushed downward,</l>
<l n="12.164">And my beard in filthy places.</l>
<l n="12.165">But indeed a man they found me,</l>
<l n="12.166">And they did not greatly fright me,</l>
<l n="12.167">I myself put forth my magic,</l>
<l n="12.168">And began my spells to mutter,</l>
<l n="12.169">Sang the wizards with their arrows,</l>
<l n="12.170">And the archers with their weapons,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="12.171">Sorcerers with their knives of iron,</l>
<l n="12.172">Soothsayers with their pointed weapons,</l>
<l n="12.173">Under Tuoni's mighty Cataract,</l>
<l n="12.174">Where the surge is most terrific,</l>
<l n="12.175">Underneath the highest cataract,</l>
<l n="12.176">'Neath the worst of all the whirlpools.</l>
<l n="12.177">There the sorcerers now may slumber,</l>
<l n="12.178">There repose beneath their blankets,</l>
<l n="12.179">Till the grass may spring above them,</l>
<l n="12.180">Through their heads and caps sprout upward,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="12.181">Through the arm-pits of the sorcerers,</l>
<l n="12.182">Piercing through their shoulder-muscles,</l>
<l n="12.183">While the wizards sleep in soundness,</l>
<l n="12.184">Sleeping there without protection."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.185">Still his mother would restrain him,</l>
<l n="12.186">Hinder Lemminkainen's journey,</l>
<l n="12.187">Once again her son dissuaded,</l>
<l n="12.188">And the dame held back the hero.</l>
<l n="12.189">"Do not go, O do not venture</l>
<l n="12.190">To that cold and dreary village,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="12.191">To the gloomy land of Pohja.</l>
<l n="12.192">There destruction sure awaits you,</l>
<l n="12.193">Evil waits for thee, unhappy,</l>
<l n="12.194">Ruin, lively Lemminkainen!</l>
<l n="12.195">Hadst thou hundred mouths to speak with,</l>
<l n="12.196">Even so, one could not think it,</l>
<l n="12.197">Nor that by thy songs of magic</l>
<l n="12.198">Lapland's sons would be confounded.</l>
<l n="12.199">For you know not Turja's language,</l>
<l n="12.200">Not the tongue they speak in Lapland."</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.201">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.202">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="12.203">As it chanced, his hair was brushing,</l>
<l n="12.204">And with greatest neatness brushed it.</l>
<l n="12.205">To the wall his brush then cast he,</l>
<l n="12.206">To the stove the comb flung after,</l>
<l n="12.207">And again he spoke and answered,</l>
<l n="12.208">In the very words which follow:</l>
<l n="12.209">"Ruin falls on Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.210">Evil waits for him unhappy,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="12.211">When the brush with blood is running,</l>
<l n="12.212">And the comb with blood is streaming."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.213">Then went lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.214">To the gloomy land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="12.215">'Spite the warnings of his mother,</l>
<l n="12.216">'Gainst the aged woman's counsel.</l>
<l n="12.217">First he armed him, and he girt him.</l>
<l n="12.218">In his coat of mail he clad him,</l>
<l n="12.219">With a belt of steel encompassed,</l>
<l n="12.220">And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="12.221">"Stronger feels a man in armour,</l>
<l n="12.222">In the best of iron mail-coats,</l>
<l n="12.223">And of steel a magic girdle,</l>
<l n="12.224">As a wizard 'gainst magicians.</l>
<l n="12.225">Then no trouble need alarm him,</l>
<l n="12.226">Nor the greatest evil fright him."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.227">Then he grasped his sword so trusty,</l>
<l n="12.228">Took his blade, like flame that glittered,</l>
<l n="12.229">Which by Hiisi's self was whetted.</l>
<l n="12.230">And by Jumala was polished.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="12.231">By his side the hero girt it,</l>
<l n="12.232">Thrust in sheath with leather lining.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.233">How shall now the man conceal him,</l>
<l n="12.234">And the mighty hero hide him?</l>
<l n="12.235">There a little time he hid him,</l>
<l n="12.236">And the mighty one concealed him,</l>
<l n="12.237">'Neath the beam above the doorway,</l>
<l n="12.238">By the doorpost of the chamber.</l>
<l n="12.239">In the courtyard by the hayloft,</l>
<l n="12.240">By the gate of all the furthest.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.241">Thus it was the hero hid him</l>
<l n="12.242">From the sight of all the women,</l>
<l n="12.243">But such art is not sufficient,</l>
<l n="12.244">And such caution would not serve him,</l>
<l n="12.245">For he likewise must protect him</l>
<l n="12.246">From the heroes of the people,</l>
<l n="12.247">There where two roads have their parting.</l>
<l n="12.248">On a blue rock's lofty summit,</l>
<l n="12.249">And upon the quaking marshes,</l>
<l n="12.250">Where the waves are swiftly coursing,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="12.251">Where the waterfall is rushing,</l>
<l n="12.252">In the winding of the rapids.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.253">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.254">Spoke the very words which follow:</l>
<l n="12.255">"Rise ye up from earth, O swordsmen,</l>
<l n="12.256">You, the earth's primeval heroes,</l>
<l n="12.257">From the wells arise, ye warriors,</l>

<l n="12.267">Come ye to protect a hero,</l>
<l n="12.268">Comrades of a youth most famous,</l>
<l n="12.269">That the sorcerers' arrows strike not,</l>

<l n="12.271">Nor the knife-blades of enchanters,</l>

<lg>
<l n="12.273">"If this be not yet sufficient,</l>

<l n="12.281">Thou amidst the clouds who breathest,</l>

<l n="12.290">And the foes who stand behind me,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="12.291">And above me and beside me,</l>

<l n="12.296">All the scoundrels with their weapons."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.297">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.298">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="12.299">From the bush his courser whistled,</l>
<l n="12.300">From the grass, the gold-maned courser.</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="12.301">Thereupon the horse he harnessed,</l>
<l n="12.302">In the shafts the fiery courser,</l>
<l n="12.303">In the sledge himself he seated,</l>
<l n="12.304">And the sledge began to rattle.</l>
<l n="12.305">O'er the horse his whip he flourished,</l>
<l n="12.306">Cracked the whip, and urged him onward,</l>
<l n="12.307">Started quickly on his journey.</l>
<l n="12.308">Rocked the sledge, the way grew shorten</l>
<l n="12.309">And the silver sand was scattered,</l>
<l n="12.310">And the golden heather crackled.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.311">Thus he drove one day, a second;</l>
<l n="12.312">Drove upon the third day likewise,</l>
<l n="12.313">And at length upon the third day</l>
<l n="12.314">Came the hero to a village.</l>
<l n="12.315">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.316">Drove the rattling sledge straight onward</l>
<l n="12.317">Forth along the furthest pathway.</l>
<l n="12.318">To the furthest of the houses,</l>
<l n="12.319">And he asked upon the thresholds</l>
<l n="12.320">Speaking from behind the window:</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="12.321">"Is there some one in this household</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.325">From the floor a child made answer.</l>
<l n="12.326">And a boy from out the doorway:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.331">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.332">O'er the horse his whip he brandished,</l>
<l n="12.333">With the beaded whip he smote him,</l>
<l n="12.334">Drove the rattling sledge straight onward,</l>
<l n="12.335">On the midmost of the pathways</l>
<l n="12.336">To the midmost of the houses,</l>
<l n="12.337">And he asked upon the threshold,</l>
<l n="12.338">And beneath the eaves he shouted:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.343">From the stove a crone responded</l>
<l n="12.344">From the stove-bench cried a gossip:</l>
<l n="12.345">"There are plenty in this household</l>
<l n="12.346">Who can hold the horse-reins for you,</l>
<l n="12.347">And the chest-bands can unloosen,</l>

<l n="12.349">Perhaps ten men may be sufficient.</l>
<l n="12.350">Or a hundred If you need them,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="12.351">Who would raise their sticks against you,</l>
<l n="12.352">Give you, too, a beast of burden,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.361">Little heeded Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.362">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="12.363">"May they shoot the crone, and club her,</l>
<l n="12.364">On her pointed chin, and kill her."</l>
<l n="12.365">Then again he hurried onward,</l>
<l n="12.366">Thundering on upon his journey,</l>
<l n="12.367">On the highest of the pathways,</l>
<l n="12.368">To the highest of the houses.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.369">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.370">Reached the house to which he journeyed,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="12.371">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="12.372">And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
<l n="12.373">"Stop the barker's mouth, O Hiisi,</l>
<l n="12.374">And the dog's jaws close, O Lempo,</l>
<l n="12.375">And his mouth securely muzzle,</l>
<l n="12.376">That his gagged teeth may be harmless,</l>

<l n="12.378">When a man is passing by him."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.379">As he came into the courtyard,</l>
<l n="12.380">On the ground he slashed his whiplash,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="12.381">From the spot a cloud rose upward,</l>
<l n="12.382">In the cloud a dwarf was standing,</l>
<l n="12.383">And he quickly loosed the chest-bands,</l>
<l n="12.384">And the shafts he then let downward.</l>
<l n="12.385">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.386">Listened with his ears attentive</l>
<l n="12.387">But no person there observed him,</l>
<l n="12.388">So that no one present knew it.</l>
<l n="12.389">Out of doors he heard a singing,</l>
<l n="12.390">Through the moss he heard them speaking,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="12.391">Through the walls heard music playing,</l>
<l n="12.392">Through the shutters heard a singing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.393">In the house he cast his glances,</l>
<l n="12.394">Gazed into the room in secret,</l>
<l n="12.395">And the house was full of wizards,</l>
<l n="12.396">And the benches full of singers,</l>
<l n="12.397">By the walls there sat musicians.</l>
<l n="12.398">Seers were sitting in the doorway,</l>
<l n="12.399">On the upper benches sorcerers,</l>
<l n="12.400">By the hearth were soothsayers seated,</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
<l n="12.401">There a Lapland bard was singing,</l>
<l n="12.402">Hoarsely singing songs of Hiisi.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.403">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.404">Thought it wise to change his figure,</l>
<l n="12.405">To another shape transformed him,</l>
<l n="12.406">Left his hiding place, and entered,</l>
<l n="12.407">Thrust himself into the chamber,</l>
<l n="12.408">And he spoke the words which follow;</l>
<l n="12.409">"Fine a song may be when ended,</l>
<l n="12.410">Grandest are the shortest verses,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
<l n="12.411">Wisdom better when unspoken,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.413">Then came Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="12.414">On the floor advancing swiftly,</l>
<l n="12.415">Till she reached the chamber's middle,</l>
<l n="12.416">And she spoke these words in answer:</l>
<l n="12.417">"Once there was a dog among us,</l>
<l n="12.418">And a shaggy iron-haired puppy,</l>
<l n="12.419">Eating flesh, of bones a biter,</l>
<l n="12.420">One who licked the blood when freshest.</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
<l n="12.421">Who among mankind may you be,</l>
<l n="12.422">Who among the list of heroes,</l>
<l n="12.423">Boldly thus the house to enter,</l>
<l n="12.424">Pushing right into the chamber,</l>
<l n="12.425">Yet the dogs have never heard you,</l>
<l n="12.426">Nor have warned us with their barking?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.427">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.428">"Surely I have not come hither,</l>
<l n="12.429">Void of art and void of knowledge,</l>
<l n="12.430">Void of strength and void of cunning,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
<l n="12.431">Taught not magic by my father.</l>
<l n="12.432">And without my parents' counsel</l>
<l n="12.433">That the dogs should now devour me,</l>
<l n="12.434">And the barkers should attack me.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.435">"But it was my mother washed me,</l>
<l n="12.436">When a boy both small and slender,</l>
<l n="12.437">Three times in the nights of summer.</l>
<l n="12.438">Nine times in the nights of autumn,</l>
<l n="12.439">And she taught me all the pathways,</l>
<l n="12.440">And the knowledge of all countries,</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
<l n="12.441">And at home sang songs of magic,</l>
<l n="12.442">Likewise too in foreign countries."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.443">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.444">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="12.445">Soon began his songs of magics</l>
<l n="12.446">All at once began his singing,</l>
<l n="12.447">Fire flashed from his fur-cloak's borders,</l>
<l n="12.448">And his eyes with flame were shining,</l>
<l n="12.449">With the songs of Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.450">As he sang his spells of magic.</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.451">Sang the very best of singers</l>
<l n="12.452">To the worst of all the singers,</l>
<l n="12.453">And he fed their mouths with pebbles.</l>
<l n="12.454">And he piled up rocks above them.</l>
<l n="12.455">On the best of all the singers,</l>
<l n="12.456">And most skilful of magicians.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.457">Then he sang the men thereafter</l>
<l n="12.458">Both to one side and the other,</l>
<l n="12.459">To the plains, all bare and treeless.</l>
<l n="12.460">To the lands, unploughed for ever,</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
<l n="12.461">To the ponds, devoid of fishes,</l>
<l n="12.462">Where no perch has ever wandered,</l>
<l n="12.463">To the dreadful falls of Rutja,</l>
<l n="12.464">And amid the roaring whirlpools,</l>

<l n="12.466">To the rocks beneath the cataract,</l>
<l n="12.467">There to burn as if 'mid fire,</l>
<l n="12.468">And to scatter sparks around them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.469">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="12.470">Sang his songs against the swordsmen.</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
<l n="12.471">Sang the heroes with their weapons,</l>
<l n="12.472">Sang the young men, sang the old men,</l>

<l n="12.474">And his songs spared one man only,</l>
<l n="12.475">And he was a wicked cowherd.</l>
<l n="12.476">Old, with eyes both closed and sightless.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.477">Markahattu then, the cowherd,</l>
<l n="12.478">Spoke the very words which follow:</l>
<l n="12.479">"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
<l n="12.480">Thou hast banned the young and old men,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="12.481">Banned the men of age between them,</l>
<l n="12.482">Wherefore hast not banned me likewise?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.483">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.484">"Therefore 'tis that I have spared thee,</l>
<l n="12.485">That thou dost appear so wretched,</l>
<l n="12.486">Pitiful without my magic.</l>
<l n="12.487">In the days when thou wast younger,</l>
<l n="12.488">Thou wast worst of all the cowherds,</l>
<l n="12.489">Hast destroyed thy mother's children,</l>
<l n="12.490">And disgraced thy very sister,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="12.491">All the horses hast thou crippled,</l>
<l n="12.492">All the foals hast thou outwearied,</l>
<l n="12.493">In the swamps or stony places,</l>
<l n="12.494">Plashing through the muddy waters."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="12.495">Markahattu then, the cowherd,</l>
<l n="12.496">Greatly vexed, and greatly angry,</l>
<l n="12.497">Through the open door went quickly,</l>
<l n="12.498">Through the yard to open country,</l>
<l n="12.499">Ran to Tuonela's deep river,</l>
<l n="12.500">To the dreadful river's whirlpool,</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="12.501">Waited there for Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="12.502">Waited there for Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="12.503">Till on his return from Pohja,</l>
<l n="12.504">He should make his journey homeward.</l>

<div type="runo" n="XIII">
<head>HIISI'S ELK</head>
<div type="argument">Lemminkainen asks the old woman of Pohja for her daughter, but she demands that he should first capture the Elk of Hiisi on snowshoes (1-30). Lemminkainen starts off in high spirits to hunt the elk, but it escapes, and he breaks his snowshoes and spear (31-270). </div>
<lg>
<l n="13.001">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="13.002">Said to Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="13.003">"Give me, old one, now your maiden,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.007">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="13.008">Answer in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="13.009">"Nay, I will not give my maiden,</l>

<l n="13.015">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="13.016">"Kylli in the town lies fettered,</l>
<l n="13.017">At the steps before the village,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.041">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="13.042">Pondered deeply and reflected</l>
<l n="13.043">How he should procure his snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.044">How they best should be constructed.</l>
<l n="13.045">Then to Kauppi's house he hastened,</l>
<l n="13.046">And to Lyylikki's forge hurried.</l>
<l n="13.047">"O thou wisest Vuojalainen,</l>
<l n="13.048">Thou the handsome Lapland Kauppi,</l>

<l n="13.053">Lyylikki then spoke as follows,</l>

<l n="13.056">Forth to hunt the elk of Hiisi;</l>
<l n="13.057">For a piece of rotten timber,</l>
<l n="13.058">Only will reward your labour."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.059">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="13.060">And he spoke the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="13.061">"Make a snowshoe left to run with,</l>

<l n="13.065">Lyylikki, the smith of snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.066">Kauppi, maker of the snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.067">In the autumn shaped the left one,</l>
<l n="13.068">In the winter carved the right one,</l>
<l n="13.069">And he fixed the frames on one day,</l>
<l n="13.070">Fixed the rings upon another.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.071">Now the left was fit to run with,</l>

<l n="13.073">And the frames were now completed,</l>
<l n="13.074">And the rings were also fitted.</l>
<l n="13.075">Frames he lined with skins of otter,</l>
<l n="13.076">And the rings with ruddy foxskin.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.077">Then he smeared with grease the snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.078">Smeared them with the fat of reindeer,</l>
<l n="13.079">And himself reflected deeply,</l>
<l n="13.080">And he spoke the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>

<l n="13.104">And with Lemminkainen's snowshoes."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.105">But the boast was heard by Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.106">And by Juutas comprehended;</l>
<l n="13.107">And an elk was formed by Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.108">And a reindeer formed by Juutas,</l>
<l n="13.109">With a head of rotten timber,</l>
<l n="13.110">Horns composed of willow-branches,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="13.111">Feet of ropes the swamps which border,</l>
<l n="13.112">Shins of sticks from out the marshes;</l>
<l n="13.113">And his back was formed of fence-stakes,</l>
<l n="13.114">Sinews formed of dryest grass-stalks,</l>
<l n="13.115">Eyes of water-lily flowers,</l>
<l n="13.116">Ears of leaves of water-lily,</l>
<l n="13.117">And his hide was formed of pine-bark,</l>
<l n="13.118">And his flesh of rotten timber.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.119">Hiisi now the elk instructed,</l>
<l n="13.120">Thus he spoke unto the reindeer:</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="13.121">"Now rush forth thou elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.122">On thy legs, O noble creature,</l>
<l n="13.123">To the breeding-place of reindeer,</l>
<l n="13.124">Grassy plains of Lapland's children,</l>
<l n="13.125">Till the snowshoe-men are sweating;</l>
<l n="13.126">Most of all, this Lemminkainen!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.127">Then rushed forth the elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.128">Sped away the fleeing reindeer,</l>
<l n="13.129">Rushing past the barns of Pohja,</l>
<l n="13.130">To the plains of Lapland's children,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="13.131">In the house the tubs kicked over,</l>
<l n="13.132">On the fire upset the kettles,</l>
<l n="13.133">Threw the meat among the ashes,</l>
<l n="13.134">Spilt the soup among the cinders.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.135">Then arose a great commotion,</l>
<l n="13.136">On the plains of Lapland's children,</l>
<l n="13.137">For the Lapland dogs were barking,</l>
<l n="13.138">And the Lapland children crying,</l>
<l n="13.139">And the Lapland women laughing,</l>
<l n="13.140">And the other people grumbling.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.141">He, the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="13.142">Chased the elk upon his snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.143">Glided o'er the land and marshes,</l>
<l n="13.144">O'er the open wastes he glided.</l>
<l n="13.145">Fire was crackling from his snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.146">From his staff's end smoke ascending,</l>
<l n="13.147">But as yet the elk he saw not;</l>
<l n="13.148">Could not see it; could not hear it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.149">O'er the hills and dales he glided,</l>
<l n="13.150">Through the lands beyond the ocean,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="13.151">Over all the wastes of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.152">Over all the heaths of Kalma,</l>
<l n="13.153">And before the mouth of Surma,</l>
<l n="13.154">And behind the house of Kalma.</l>
<l n="13.155">Surma's mouth was quickly opened,</l>
<l n="13.156">Down was bowed the head of Kalma,</l>
<l n="13.157">That he thus might seize the hero,</l>
<l n="13.158">And might swallow Lemminkainen;</l>
<l n="13.159">But he tried, and failed to reach him,</l>
<l n="13.160">Failed completely in his effort.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.161">O'er all lands he had not skated,</l>
<l n="13.162">Nor had reached the desert's borders,</l>
<l n="13.163">In the furthest bounds of Pohja,</l>
<l n="13.164">In the distant realms of Lapland,</l>
<l n="13.165">So he skated further onward,</l>
<l n="13.166">Till he reached the desert's borders.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.167">When he reached this distant region,</l>
<l n="13.168">Then he heard a great commotion,</l>
<l n="13.169">In the furthest bounds of Pohja,</l>
<l n="13.170">On the plains of Lapland's children.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="13.171">And he heard the dogs were barking,</l>
<l n="13.172">And the Lapland children crying,</l>
<l n="13.173">And the Lapland women laughing,</l>
<l n="13.174">And the other Lapps were grumbling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.175">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="13.176">Skated on in that direction,</l>
<l n="13.177">Where he heard the dogs were barking</l>
<l n="13.178">On the plains of Lapland's children;</l>
<l n="13.179">And he said on his arrival,</l>
<l n="13.180">And he asked them on his coming:</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="13.181">"Wherefore are the women laughing,</l>
<l n="13.182">Women laughing, children crying,</l>
<l n="13.183">And the older folks lamenting,</l>
<l n="13.184">And the grey dogs all are barking?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.185">"Therefore are the women laughing,</l>
<l n="13.186">Women laughing, children crying,</l>
<l n="13.187">And the older folks lamenting,</l>
<l n="13.188">And the grey dogs all are barking.</l>
<l n="13.189">Here has charged the elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.190">With its hoofs all cleft and polished,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="13.191">In the house the tubs kicked over,</l>
<l n="13.192">On the fire upset the kettles,</l>
<l n="13.193">Shaken out the soup within them,</l>
<l n="13.194">Spilt it all among the ashes."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.195">Thereupon the ruddy rascal,</l>
<l n="13.196">He the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="13.197">Struck his left shoe in the snowdrift,</l>
<l n="13.198">Like an adder in the meadow,</l>
<l n="13.199">Pushed his staff of pinewood forward,</l>
<l n="13.200">As it were a living serpent,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="13.201">And he said as he was gliding,</l>
<l n="13.202">Grasping firm the pole he carried:</l>
<l n="13.203">"Let the men who live in Lapland,</l>
<l n="13.204">Help me all to bring the elk home;</l>
<l n="13.205">And let all the Lapland women</l>
<l n="13.206">Set to work to wash the kettles;</l>
<l n="13.207">And let all the Lapland children</l>
<l n="13.208">Hasten forth to gather splinters;</l>
<l n="13.209">And let all the Lapland kettles</l>
<l n="13.210">Help to cook the elk when captured."</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.211">Then he poised himself and balanced,</l>
<l n="13.212">Forward pushed, his strength exerting,</l>
<l n="13.213">And the first time he shot forward,</l>
<l n="13.214">From before their eyes he vanished.</l>
<l n="13.215">Once again he speeded onward,</l>
<l n="13.216">And they could no longer hear him,</l>
<l n="13.217">But the third time he rushed onward,</l>
<l n="13.218">Then he reached the elk of Hiisi.</l>
<l n="13.219">Then he took a pole of maple,</l>
<l n="13.220">And he made a birchen collar;"</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="13.221">Hiisi's elk he tethered with it,</l>
<l n="13.222">In a pen of oak he placed it.</l>
<l n="13.223">"Stand thou there, O elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.224">Here remain, O nimble reindeer!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.225">Then upon the back he stroked it,</l>
<l n="13.226">Patted it upon the belly.</l>
<l n="13.227">"Would that I awhile might tarry,</l>
<l n="13.228">And might sleep awhile and rest me,</l>
<l n="13.229">Here beside a youthful maiden,</l>
<l n="13.230">With a dove of blooming beauty."</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.231">Then did Hiisi's elk grow furious,</l>
<l n="13.232">And the reindeer kicked out wildly,</l>
<l n="13.233">And it spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="13.234">"Lempo's self shall reckon with you,</l>
<l n="13.235">If you sleep beside a maiden,</l>
<l n="13.236">And beside a girl should tarry."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.237">Then it gave a mighty struggle,</l>
<l n="13.238">And it snapped the birchen collar,</l>
<l n="13.239">And it broke the pole of maple,</l>
<l n="13.240">And the pen of oak burst open,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="13.241">And began to hurry forwards,</l>
<l n="13.242">And the elk rushed wildly onwards,</l>
<l n="13.243">Over land and over marshes,</l>
<l n="13.244">Over slopes o'ergrown with bushes,</l>
<l n="13.245">Till the eyes no more could see it,</l>
<l n="13.246">And the ears no longer hear it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.247">Thereupon the ruddy rascal</l>
<l n="13.248">Grew both sorrowful and angry,</l>
<l n="13.249">Very vexed and very angry,</l>
<l n="13.250">And would chase the elk of Hiisi,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="13.251">But as he was rushing forward,</l>
<l n="13.252">In a hole he broke his left shoe,</l>
<l n="13.253">And his snowshoe fell to pieces,</l>
<l n="13.254">On the ground he broke the right one,</l>
<l n="13.255">Broke the tips from off his snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.256">And the frames across the joinings.</l>
<l n="13.257">While rushed on the elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="13.258">Till its head he saw no longer.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="13.259">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="13.260">Bowed his head in deep depression,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="13.261">Gazed upon the broken snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.262">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="13.263">"Nevermore in all his lifetime</l>
<l n="13.264">May another hunter venture</l>
<l n="13.265">Confidently to the forest,</l>
<l n="13.266">Chasing Hiisi's elk on snowshoes!</l>
<l n="13.267">Since I went, O me unhappy,</l>
<l n="13.268">And have spoilt the best of snowshoes,</l>
<l n="13.269">And the splendid frames have shattered,</l>
<l n="13.270">And my spearpoint likewise broken."</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN'S DEATH</head>
<div type="argument">Lemminkainen invokes the forest deities, and at length succeeds in capturing the elk, and brings it to Pohjola (1-270). Another task is given him, to bridle the fire-breathing steed of Hiisi. He bridles it and brings it to Pohjola (271-372). A third task is assigned him, to shoot a swan on the river of Tuonela, Lemminkainen comes to the river, but the despised cowherd, who is lying in wait for him, kills him, and casts his body into the cataract of Tuoni. The son of Tuoni then cuts his body to pieces (373-460).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="14.001">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="14.002">Deeply pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="14.003">On the path that he should follow,</l>
<l n="14.004">Whither he should turn his footsteps,</l>
<l n="14.005">Should he leave the elk of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="14.006">And direct his journey homewards,</l>
<l n="14.007">Should he make another effort.</l>
<l n="14.008">And pursue the chase on snowshoes,</l>
<l n="14.009">With the Forest-Queen's permission,</l>
<l n="14.010">And the favour of the wood-nymphs?</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="14.011">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="14.012">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="14.013">"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="14.014">Gracious Father in the heavens,</l>
<l n="14.015">Make me now two better snowshoes,</l>

<lg>
<l n="14.079">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="14.080">Wandered on, but found no booty,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="14.081">Glided through the plains and marshes,</l>
<l n="14.082">Glided through the trackless forests,</l>
<l n="14.083">Where has Jumala his soot-hills,</l>
<l n="14.084">To the charcoal heaths of Hiisi.</l>
<l n="14.085">Thus he skated one day, two days,</l>
<l n="14.086">And at length upon the third day,</l>
<l n="14.087">Came he to a lofty mountain,</l>

<l n="14.090">To the north across the marshes,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="14.091">And he saw the farms of Tapio,</l>

<l n="14.095">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="14.096">Quickly to the spot approaching,</l>
<l n="14.097">Pushed his way through all obstructions,</l>
<l n="14.098">Under Tapio's very windows.</l>

<l n="14.100">In the sixth among the windows.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="14.101">There were resting game-dispensers,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="14.279">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="14.280">Took at once a golden bridle,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="14.281">Took a halter all of silver,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="14.285">Then he hastened on his journey,</l>

<l n="14.287">Through the green and open meadows,</l>
<l n="14.288">To the sacred field beyond them,</l>

<l n="14.293">Thus he sought one day, a second,</l>
<l n="14.294">And at length upon the third day</l>
<l n="14.295">Came he to a lofty mountain,</l>
<l n="14.296">And upon a rock he clambered.</l>
<l n="14.297">And he turned his eyes to eastward,</l>
<l n="14.298">And he turned his head to sunwards.</l>
<l n="14.299">On the sand he saw the courser,</l>

<l n="14.323">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="14.324">Forward stepped to gaze about him,</l>
<l n="14.325">And advanced for observation,</l>

<l n="14.339">With a rope I will not flog you,</l>
<l n="14.340">With a switch I will not drive you,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="14.341">But with silken cords will lead you,</l>
<l n="14.342">With a strip of cloth will drive you."</l>

<l n="14.343">Then the chestnut horse of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="14.344">Hiisi's horse, with mane all foam-flecked</l>
<l n="14.345">Forward stretched his golden muzzle,</l>

<lg>
<l n="14.349">Thus did lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="14.350">Bridle Hiisi's mighty courser,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="14.351">In his mouth the bit adjusted,</l>

<lg>
<l n="14.355">O'er the horse his whip he brandished,</l>

<l n="14.411">Through the arm-pit left it smote him,</l>

<l n="14.413">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="14.414">Felt himself severely wounded,</l>

<l n="14.417">That I asked not information</l>
<l n="14.418">From my mother, she who bore me.</l>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN'S RECOVERY AND RETURN HOME</head>
<div type="argument">One day blood begins to trickle from the hair-brush at Lemminkainen's home, and his mother at once perceives that death has overtaken her son. She hastens to Pohjola and inquires of Louhi what has become of him (1-100). The Mistress of Pohjola at length tells her on what errand she has sent him, and the sun gives her full information of the manner of Lemminkainen's death (101-194). Lemminkainen's mother goes with a long rake in her hand under the cataract of Tuoni, and rakes the water till she has found all the fragments of her son's body, which she joins together, and succeeds in restoring Lemminkainen to life by charms and magic salves (195-554). Lemminkainen then relates how he perished in the river of Tuonela, and returns home with his mother (555-650).

<lg>
<l n="15.001">Lemminkainen's tender mother</l>
<l n="15.002">In her home was always thinking,</l>
<l n="15.003">"Where has Lemminkainen wandered,</l>
<l n="15.004">Whereabouts is Kauko roaming,</l>
<l n="15.005">For I do not hear him coming</l>
<l n="15.006">From his world-extended journey?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.007">Ah, the hapless mother knew not,</l>
<l n="15.008">Nor the hapless one imagined,</l>
<l n="15.009">Where her own flesh now was floating,</l>
<l n="15.010">Where her own blood now was flowing;"</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="15.011">If he tracked the fir-clad mountains,</l>
<l n="15.012">Or among the heaths was roaming,</l>
<l n="15.013">Or upon a lake was floating,</l>
<l n="15.014">Out upon the foaming billows,</l>
<l n="15.015">Or in some terrific combat,</l>
<l n="15.016">In the most tremendous tumult,</l>
<l n="15.017">With his legs with blood bespattered,</l>
<l n="15.018">To the knees with blood all crimsoned.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.019">Kyllikki, the lovely housewife,</l>
<l n="15.020">Wandered round and gazed about her,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="15.021">Through the home of Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="15.022">And through Kaukomieli's homestead;</l>
<l n="15.023">On the comb she looked at evening,</l>
<l n="15.024">On the brush she looked at morning,</l>
<l n="15.025">And at length one day it happened,</l>
<l n="15.026">In the early morning hours,</l>
<l n="15.027">Blood from out the comb was oozing,</l>
<l n="15.028">From the brush was gore distilling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.029">Kyllikki, the lovely housewife,</l>
<l n="15.030">Uttered then the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="15.031">"Lo, my husband has departed,</l>
<l n="15.032">And my handsome Kauko wandered</l>
<l n="15.033">In a country void of houses,</l>
<l n="15.034">And throughout some trackless desert.</l>
<l n="15.035">Blood from out the comb is oozing,</l>
<l n="15.036">Gore is from the brush distilling."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.037">Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="15.038">See herself the comb was bleeding,</l>
<l n="15.039">And began to weep with sorrow.</l>
<l n="15.040">"O alas, my day is wretched,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="15.041">And my life is most unhappy,</l>
<l n="15.042">For my son has met misfortune,</l>
<l n="15.043">And my child all unprotected,</l>
<l n="15.044">On an evil day was nurtured.</l>
<l n="15.045">On the poor lad came destruction,</l>
<l n="15.046">Lost is darling Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="15.047">From the comb the blood is trickling,</l>
<l n="15.048">And the brush with blood is dripping."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.049">In her hands her skirt she gathered,</l>
<l n="15.050">With her arms her dress she lifted,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="15.051">And at once commenced her journey,</l>
<l n="15.052">Hurried on upon her journey.</l>
<l n="15.053">Mountains thundered 'neath her footsteps,</l>
<l n="15.054">Valleys rose and hills were levelled,</l>
<l n="15.055">And the high ground sank before her,</l>
<l n="15.056">And the low ground rose before her.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.057">Thus to Pohjola she journeyed,</l>
<l n="15.058">Asking where her son had wandered,</l>
<l n="15.059">And she asked in words which follow:</l>
<l n="15.060">"Tell me, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="15.061">Whither sent you Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="15.062">Whither has my son departed?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.063">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="15.064">Then replied in words which follow:</l>
<l n="15.065">"Of your son I know no tidings,</l>
<l n="15.066">Where he went, or where he vanished.</l>
<l n="15.067">In his sledge I yoked a stallion,</l>
<l n="15.068">Chose him out a fiery courser.</l>
<l n="15.069">Perhaps he sank in ice when rotten,</l>
<l n="15.070">O'er the frozen lake when driving,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="15.071">Or among the wolves has fallen,</l>
<l n="15.072">Or some dreadful bear devoured him."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.073">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="15.074">"This indeed is shameless lying,</l>
<l n="15.075">For no wolf would touch my offspring.</l>
<l n="15.076">Not a bear touch Lemminkainen!</l>
<l n="15.077">Wolves he'd crush between his fingers,</l>
<l n="15.078">Bears with naked hands would master.</l>
<l n="15.079">If you will not truly tell me,</l>
<l n="15.080">How you treated Lemminkainen,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="15.081">I the malthouse doors will shatter,</l>
<l n="15.082">Break the hinges of the Sampo."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.083">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="15.084">"I have fed the man profusely,</l>
<l n="15.085">And I gave him drink in plenty,</l>
<l n="15.086">Till he was most fully sated.</l>
<l n="15.087">In a boat's prow then I placed him,</l>
<l n="15.088">That he thus should shoot the rapids,</l>
<l n="15.089">But I really cannot tell you</l>
<l n="15.090">What befel the wretched creature;</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="15.091">In the wildly foaming torrent,</l>
<l n="15.092">In the tumult of the whirlpool."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.093">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="15.094">"This indeed is shameless lying.</l>
<l n="15.095">Tell me now the truth exactly,</l>
<l n="15.096">Make an end of all your lying,</l>
<l n="15.097">Whither sent you Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="15.098">Where has Kaleva's son perished?</l>
<l n="15.099">Or most certain death awaits you,</l>
<l n="15.100">And you die upon the instant."</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.101">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="15.102">"Now at length I'll tell you truly.</l>
<l n="15.103">Forth to chase the elks I sent him,</l>
<l n="15.104">And to struggle with the monsters,</l>
<l n="15.105">And the mighty beasts to bridle,</l>
<l n="15.106">And to put the foals in harness.</l>
<l n="15.107">Then I sent him forth swan-hunting,</l>
<l n="15.108">Seeking for the bird so sacred,</l>
<l n="15.109">But I really cannot tell you</l>
<l n="15.110">If misfortune came upon him,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="15.111">Or what hindrance he encountered.</l>
<l n="15.112">Nought I heard of his returning,</l>
<l n="15.113">For the bride that he demanded,</l>
<l n="15.114">When he came to woo my daughter."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.115">Then the mother sought the strayed one,</l>
<l n="15.116">Dreading what mischance had happened,</l>
<l n="15.117">Like a wolf she tracked the marshes,</l>
<l n="15.118">Like a bear the wastes she traversed,</l>
<l n="15.119">Like an otter swam the waters,</l>
<l n="15.120">Badger-like the plains she traversed,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="15.121">Passed the headlands like a hedgehog,</l>
<l n="15.122">Like a hare along the lakeshores,</l>
<l n="15.123">Pushed the rocks from out her pathway,</l>
<l n="15.124">From the slopes bent down the tree-trunks,</l>
<l n="15.125">Thrust the shrubs beside her pathway,</l>
<l n="15.126">From her track she cast the branches.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.127">Long she vainly sought the strayed one,</l>
<l n="15.128">Long she sought, but found him never.</l>
<l n="15.129">Of her son the trees she questioned,</l>
<l n="15.130">For the lost one ever seeking.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="15.131">Said a tree, then sighed a pine-tree,</l>
<l n="15.132">And an oak made answer wisely:</l>
<l n="15.133">"I myself have also sorrows,</l>
<l n="15.134">For your son I cannot trouble,</l>
<l n="15.135">For my lot's indeed a hard one,</l>
<l n="15.136">And an evil day awaits me,</l>
<l n="15.137">For they split me into splinters,</l>
<l n="15.138">And they chop me into faggots,</l>
<l n="15.139">In the kiln that I may perish,</l>
<l n="15.140">Or they fell me in the clearing."</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.141">Long she vainly sought the strayed one,</l>
<l n="15.142">Long she sought, but found him never,</l>
<l n="15.143">And whene'er she crossed a pathway,</l>
<l n="15.144">Then she bowed herself before it.</l>
<l n="15.145">"O thou path whom God created,</l>
<l n="15.146">Hast thou seen my son pass over;</l>
<l n="15.147">Hast thou seen my golden apple,</l>
<l n="15.148">Hast thou seen my staff of silver?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.149">But the path made answer wisely,</l>
<l n="15.150">And it spoke and gave her answer:"</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="15.151">"I myself have also sorrows,</l>
<l n="15.152">For your son I cannot trouble,</l>
<l n="15.153">For my lot's indeed a hard one,</l>
<l n="15.154">And an evil day awaits me.</l>
<l n="15.155">All the dogs go leaping o'er me,</l>
<l n="15.156">And the horsemen gallop o'er me,</l>
<l n="15.157">And the shoes walk heavy on me,</l>
<l n="15.158">And the heels press hardly on me."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.159">Long she vainly sought the strayed one,</l>
<l n="15.160">Long she sought, but found him never.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="15.161">Met the moon upon her pathway,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.167">Then the moon whom God created,</l>
<l n="15.168">Made a full and prudent answer:</l>

<l n="15.171">For my lot's indeed a hard one,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.177">Long she vainly sought the strayed one,</l>
<l n="15.178">Long she sought, but found him never,</l>
<l n="15.179">Met the sun upon her pathway,</l>
<l n="15.180">And before the sun she bowed her.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.181">"O thou sun, whom God created,</l>
<l n="15.182">Hast thou seen my son pass by you,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.185">And the sun knew all about it,</l>
<l n="15.186">And the sun made answer plainly:</l>
<l n="15.187">"There has gone your son unhappy,</l>
<l n="15.188">He has fallen and has perished,</l>
<l n="15.189">Down in Tuoni's murky river,</l>

<l n="15.191">There in the tremendous cataract,</l>

<l n="15.194">There in Manala's deep valleys."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.195">Then did Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="15.196">Break out suddenly in weeping.</l>
<l n="15.197">To the craftsman's forge she wended:</l>
<l n="15.198">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="15.199">Thou hast worked before, and yestreen.</l>
<l n="15.200">On this very day O forge me,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="15.201">Forge a rake with copper handle,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.205">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="15.206">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="15.207">Forged a rake with copper handle,</l>
<l n="15.208">And the teeth of steel he fashioned,</l>

<l n="15.210">And of fathoms five the handle.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.211">Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="15.212">Take the mighty rake of iron,</l>
<l n="15.213">And she rushed to Tuoni's river,</l>
<l n="15.214">To the sun her prayer addressing:</l>
<l n="15.215">"O thou sun whom God created,</l>
<l n="15.216">Brilliant work of the Creator!</l>
<l n="15.217">Shine an hour with heat excessive,</l>

<l n="15.220">Lull to sleep the race of evil,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="15.221">And in Manala the strong ones,</l>
<l n="15.222">Weary out the power of Tuoni!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.223">Then the sun whom God created,</l>
<l n="15.224">Shining work of the Creator,</l>
<l n="15.225">Stooped upon a crooked birch-tree,</l>
<l n="15.226">Sank upon a crooked alder,</l>
<l n="15.227">Shone an hour with heat excessive,</l>
<l n="15.228">Shone again with sultry shimmering,</l>
<l n="15.229">And again with utmost vigour,</l>
<l n="15.230">Lulled to sleep the race of evil,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="15.231">And in Manala the strong ones.</l>
<l n="15.232">Slept the young on sword-hilt resting,</l>
<l n="15.233">And the old folks staff-supported,</l>
<l n="15.234">And the spear-men middle-aged.</l>
<l n="15.235">Then again he hastened upward,</l>
<l n="15.236">Sought again the heights of heaven,</l>
<l n="15.237">Sought again his former station,</l>
<l n="15.238">To his first abode soared upward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.239">Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="15.240">Take the mighty rake of iron,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="15.241">And to seek her son was raking</l>
<l n="15.242">All amid the raging cataract,</l>
<l n="15.243">Through the fiercely rushing torrent,</l>
<l n="15.244">And she raked, yet found she nothing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.245">Then she went and sought him deeper,</l>
<l n="15.246">Ever deeper in the water,</l>
<l n="15.247">Stocking-deep into the water,</l>
<l n="15.248">Standing waist-deep in the water.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.249">Thus she sought her son by raking</l>
<l n="15.250">All the length of Tuoni's river,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="15.251">And she raked against the current,</l>
<l n="15.252">Once and twice she raked the river,</l>
<l n="15.253">And his shirt at length discovered,</l>
<l n="15.254">Found the shirt of him unhappy,</l>
<l n="15.255">And she raked again a third time,</l>
<l n="15.256">And she found his hat and stockings,</l>
<l n="15.257">Found his stockings, greatly sorrowing,</l>
<l n="15.258">Found his hat, with heart-wrung anguish.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.259">Then she waded ever deeper,</l>
<l n="15.260">Down in Manala's abysses,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="15.261">Raked once more along the river,</l>
<l n="15.262">Raked again across the river,</l>
<l n="15.263">And obliquely through the water,</l>
<l n="15.264">And at length upon the third time,</l>
<l n="15.265">Up she drew a lifeless carcass,</l>
<l n="15.266">With the mighty rake of iron.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.267">Yet it was no lifeless carcass,</l>
<l n="15.268">But the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="15.269">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="15.270">Sticking fast upon the rake-prongs,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="15.271">Sticking by his nameless finger,</l>
<l n="15.272">And the toes upon his left foot.</l>

<l n="15.273">Thus she fished up Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="15.274">Kaleva's great offspring lifted,</l>
<l n="15.275">On the rake all shod with copper,</l>
<l n="15.276">To the light above the water.</l>
<l n="15.277">Yet were many fragments wanting,</l>
<l n="15.278">Half his head, a hand was wanting,</l>
<l n="15.279">Many other little fragments,</l>
<l n="15.280">And his very life was wanting.</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.281">As his mother pondered o'er it,</l>
<l n="15.282">Thus she spoke while sorely weeping:</l>
<l n="15.283">"Can a man from this be fashioned,</l>
<l n="15.284">And a hero new created?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.285">But by chance a raven heard her,</l>
<l n="15.286">And he answered her in thiswise:</l>
<l n="15.287">"No man can from this be fashioned,</l>
<l n="15.288">Not from what you have discovered,</l>
<l n="15.289">For his eyes the powan's eaten,</l>
<l n="15.290">And the pike has cleft his shoulders.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="15.291">Cast the man into the water,</l>

<l n="15.294">Or a whale from thence developed."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.295">Lemminkainen's mother would not</l>
<l n="15.296">Cast her son into the water,</l>
<l n="15.297">But again began her raking,</l>
<l n="15.298">With the mighty rake of copper,</l>
<l n="15.299">All through Tuonela's deep river,</l>
<l n="15.300">First along it, then across it,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="15.301">And his head and hand discovered,</l>
<l n="15.302">And the fragments of his backbone.</l>
<l n="15.303">Then she found his ribs in pieces,</l>
<l n="15.304">Likewise many other fragments,</l>
<l n="15.305">And her son she pieced together,</l>
<l n="15.306">Shaped the lively Lemminkainen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.307">Then the flesh to flesh she fitted,</l>
<l n="15.308">And the bones together fitted,</l>
<l n="15.309">And the joints together jointed,</l>
<l n="15.310">And the veins she pressed together.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.311">Then she bound the veins together,</l>
<l n="15.312">All their ends she knit together,</l>
<l n="15.313">And with care their threads she counted,</l>
<l n="15.314">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="15.421">Then she spoke the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.437">Then the bee, that active hero,</l>
<l n="15.438">Flew again on whirring pinions,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.449">In this spot was cooked the honey,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.455">Then the bee, that active hero,</l>
<l n="15.456">Gathered honey in the meadow,</l>
<l n="15.457">And a little time passed over,</l>
<l n="15.458">Very little time passed over,</l>
<l n="15.459">When he came on whirring pinions,</l>

<l n="15.461">In his lap six cups he carried,</l>

<l n="15.465">Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="15.466">Salve him with this precious ointment,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.471">Then she spoke the words which follow,</l>

<l n="15.476">And through nine heavens fly thou swiftly.</l>
<l n="15.477">There is honey in abundance,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.489">But the bee, the bird of wisdom.</l>
<l n="15.490">Answered her in words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>

<l n="15.501">On the third day soaring higher.</l>

<l n="15.506">And the regions of the blessed."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.507">From the earth the bee rose swiftly,</l>
<l n="15.508">On his honeyed wings rose whirring,</l>
<l n="15.509">And he soared on rapid pinions,</l>
<l n="15.510">On his little wings flew upward.</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
<l n="15.511">Swiftly past the moon he hurried,</l>

<l n="15.513">Rose upon the Great Bear's shoulders,</l>
<l n="15.514">O'er the Seven Stars' backs rose upward,</l>
<l n="15.515">Flew to the Creator's cellars,</l>
<l n="15.516">To the halls of the Almighty.</l>
<l n="15.517">There the drugs were well concocted,</l>
<l n="15.518">And the ointment duly tempered</l>
<l n="15.519">In the pots composed of silver,</l>

<l n="15.521">In the midst they boiled the honey,</l>

<l n="15.523">To the southward there was nectar,</l>
<l n="15.524">To the northward there was ointment.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.525">Then the bee, that bird aerial,</l>
<l n="15.526">Gathered honey in abundance,</l>
<l n="15.527">Honey to his heart's contentment.</l>
<l n="15.528">And but little time passed over,</l>
<l n="15.529">Ere the bee again came buzzing,</l>

<l n="15.531">In his lap of horns a hundred,</l>
<l n="15.532">And a thousand other vessels,</l>
<l n="15.533">Some of honey, some of liquid,</l>
<l n="15.534">And the best of all the ointment.</l>

<l n="15.535">Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="15.536">Raise it to her mouth and taste it,</l>
<l n="15.537">With her tongue the ointment tasted,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="15.543">Then did she anoint the patient,</l>
<l n="15.544">That she thus might cure his weakness,</l>
<l n="15.545">Salved the bones along the fractures,</l>
<l n="15.546">And between the joints she salved him,</l>
<l n="15.547">Salved his head and lower portions,</l>
<l n="15.548">Rubbed him also in the middle,</l>
<l n="15.549">Then she spoke the words which follow,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN IN TUONELA</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen orders Sampsa Pellervoinen to seek for wood for boat-building. He makes a boat, but finds himself at a loss for want of three magic words (1-118). As he cannot otherwise obtain them, he goes to Tuonela hoping to procure them there (119-362). Väinämöinen finally escapes from Tuonela, and after his return warns others not to venture there, and describes what a terrible place it is and the horrible abodes in which men dwell there (363-412).

<lg>
<l n="16.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.002">He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
<l n="16.003">Set to work a boat to build him,</l>
<l n="16.004">And upon a boat to labour,</l>
<l n="16.005">There upon the cloudy headland,</l>
<l n="16.006">On the shady island's summit.</l>
<l n="16.007">But the workman found no timber,</l>
<l n="16.008">Boards to build the boat he found not.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.009">Who shall seek for timber for him,</l>
<l n="16.010">And shall seek an oak-tree for him,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="16.011">For the boat of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.012">And a keel to suit the minstrel?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.013">Pellervoinen, earth-begotten,</l>
<l n="16.014">Sampsa, youth of smallest stature,</l>
<l n="16.015">He shall seek for timber for him,</l>
<l n="16.016">And shall seek an oak-tree for him.</l>
<l n="16.017">For the boat of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.018">And a keel to suit the minstrel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.019">So upon his path he wandered</l>
<l n="16.020">Through the regions to the north-east,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="16.021">Through one district, then another,</l>
<l n="16.022">Journeyed after through a third one,</l>
<l n="16.023">With his gold axe on his shoulder,</l>
<l n="16.024">With his axe, with copper handle,</l>
<l n="16.025">Till he found an aspen standing,</l>
<l n="16.026">Which in height three fathoms measured.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.027">So he went to fell the aspen,</l>
<l n="16.028">With his axe the tree to sever,</l>
<l n="16.029">And the aspen spoke and asked him,</l>
<l n="16.030">With its tongue it spoke in thiswise:</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="16.031">"What, O man, desire you from me?</l>
<l n="16.032">Tell your need, as far as may be."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.033">Youthful Sampsa Pellervoinen,</l>
<l n="16.034">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.035">"This is what I wish for from thee,</l>
<l n="16.036">This I need, and this require I,</l>
<l n="16.037">'Tis a boat for Väinämöinen;</l>
<l n="16.038">For the minstrel's boat the timber."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.039">And the aspen said astounded,</l>
<l n="16.040">Answered with its hundred branches:</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="16.041">"As a boat I should be leaking,</l>
<l n="16.042">And would only sink beneath you,</l>
<l n="16.043">For my branches they are hollow.</l>
<l n="16.044">Thrice already in this summer,</l>
<l n="16.045">Has a grub my heart devoured,</l>
<l n="16.046">In my roots a worm has nestled."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.047">Youthful Sampsa Pellervoinen</l>
<l n="16.048">Wandered further on his journey,</l>
<l n="16.049">And he wandered, deeply pondering,</l>
<l n="16.050">In the region to the northward.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.051">There he found a pine-tree standing,</l>
<l n="16.052">And its height was full six fathoms,</l>
<l n="16.053">And he struck it with his hatchet,</l>
<l n="16.054">On the trunk with axe-blade smote it,</l>
<l n="16.055">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.056">"O thou pine-tree, shall I take thee,</l>
<l n="16.057">For the boat of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.058">And as boatwood for the minstrel?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.059">But the pine-tree answered quickly,</l>
<l n="16.060">And it cried in answer loudly,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="16.061">"For a boat you cannot use me,</l>
<l n="16.062">Nor a six-ribbed boat can fashion,</l>
<l n="16.063">Full of knots you'll find the pine-tree.</l>
<l n="16.064">Thrice already in this summer,</l>
<l n="16.065">In my summit croaked a raven,</l>
<l n="16.066">Croaked a crow among my branches."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.067">Youthful Sampsa Pellervoinen</l>
<l n="16.068">Further yet pursued his journey,</l>
<l n="16.069">And he wandered, deeply pondering,</l>
<l n="16.070">In the region to the southward,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="16.071">Till he found an oak-tree standings</l>
<l n="16.072">Fathoms nine its boughs extended.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.073">And he thus addressed and asked it:</l>
<l n="16.074">"O thou oak-tree, shall I take thee,</l>
<l n="16.075">For the keel to make a vessel,</l>
<l n="16.076">The foundation of a warship?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.077">And the oak-tree answered wisely,</l>
<l n="16.078">Answered thus the acorn-bearer:</l>
<l n="16.079">"Yes, indeed, my wood is suited</l>
<l n="16.080">For the keel to make a vessel,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="16.081">Neither slender 'tis, nor knotted,</l>
<l n="16.082">For within its substance hollow.</l>
<l n="16.083">Thrice already in this summer,</l>
<l n="16.084">In the brightest days of summer,</l>
<l n="16.085">Through my midst the sunbeams wandered.</l>
<l n="16.086">On my crown the moon was shining,</l>
<l n="16.087">In my branches cried the cuckoos.</l>
<l n="16.088">In my boughs the birds were resting."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.089">Youthful Sampsa Pellervoinen</l>
<l n="16.090">Took the axe from off his shoulder,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="16.091">With his axe he smote the tree-trunk,</l>
<l n="16.092">With the blade he smote the oak-tree.</l>
<l n="16.093">Speedily he felled the oak-tree,</l>
<l n="16.094">And the beauteous tree had fallen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.095">First he hewed it through the summit,</l>
<l n="16.096">All the trunk he cleft in pieces,</l>
<l n="16.097">After this the keel he fashioned,</l>
<l n="16.098">Planks so many none could count them.</l>
<l n="16.099">For the vessel of the minstrel,</l>
<l n="16.100">For the boat of Väinämöinen.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.101">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.102">He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
<l n="16.103">Fashioned then the boat with wisdom,</l>
<l n="16.104">Built with magic songs the vessel,</l>
<l n="16.105">From the fragments of an oak-tree,</l>
<l n="16.106">Fragments of the shattered oak-tree.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.107">With a song the keel he fashioned,</l>
<l n="16.108">With another, sides he fashioned,</l>
<l n="16.109">And he sang again a third time.</l>
<l n="16.110">And the rudder he constructed,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="16.111">Bound the rib-ends firm together,</l>
<l n="16.112">And the joints he fixed together.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.113">When the boat's ribs were constructed,</l>
<l n="16.114">And the sides were fixed together,</l>
<l n="16.115">Still he found three words were wanting,</l>
<l n="16.116">Which the sides should fix securely,</l>
<l n="16.117">Fix the prow in right position,</l>
<l n="16.118">And the stern should likewise finish.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.119">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.120">He the great primeval minstrel,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="16.121">Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.122">"Woe to me, my life is wretched,</l>
<l n="16.123">For my boat unlaunched remaineth,</l>
<l n="16.124">On the waves the new boat floats not!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.125">So he pondered and reflected</l>
<l n="16.126">How to find the words he needed,</l>
<l n="16.127">And obtain the spells of magic,</l>
<l n="16.128">From among the brains of swallows,</l>
<l n="16.129">From the heads of flocks of wild swans,</l>
<l n="16.130">From the shoulders of the goose-flocks.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.131">Then he went the words to gather,</l>
<l n="16.132">And a flock of swans he slaughtered.</l>
<l n="16.133">And a flock of geese he slaughtered,</l>
<l n="16.134">And beheaded many swallows,</l>
<l n="16.135">But the spells he needed found not.</l>
<l n="16.136">Not a word, not e'en a half one.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.137">So he pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="16.138">"I shall find such words by hundreds,</l>
<l n="16.139">'Neath the tongue of summer reindeer,</l>
<l n="16.140">In the mouth of whitest squirrel."</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.141">So he went the words to gather,</l>
<l n="16.142">That the spells he might discover,</l>
<l n="16.143">And a field he spread with reindeer,</l>
<l n="16.144">Loaded benches high with squirrels.</l>
<l n="16.145">Many words he thus discovered,</l>
<l n="16.146">But they all were useless to him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.147">So he pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="16.148">"I should find such words by hundreds</l>
<l n="16.149">In the dark abodes of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="16.150">In the eternal home of Mana."</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.151">Then to Tuonela he journeyed,</l>
<l n="16.152">Sought the words in Mana's kingdom.</l>
<l n="16.153">And with rapid steps he hastened,</l>
<l n="16.154">Wandered for a week through bushes,</l>
<l n="16.155">Through bird-cherry for a second,</l>
<l n="16.156">And through juniper the third week,</l>
<l n="16.157">Straight to Manala's dread island.</l>
<l n="16.158">And the gleaming hills of Tuoni.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.159">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast.</l>
<l n="16.160">Raised his voice, and shouted loudly</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="16.161">There by Tuonela's deep river,</l>
<l n="16.162">There in Manala's abysses:</l>
<l n="16.163">"Bring a boat, O Tuoni's daughter,</l>
<l n="16.164">Row across, O child of Mana,</l>
<l n="16.165">That the stream I may pass over.</l>
<l n="16.166">And that I may cross the river."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.167">Tuoni's short and stunted daughter.</l>
<l n="16.168">She the dwarfish maid of Mana,</l>
<l n="16.169">At the time her clothes was washing,</l>
<l n="16.170">And her clothes she there was beating,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="16.171">At the river dark of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="16.172">And in Manala's deep waters.</l>
<l n="16.173">And she answered him in thiswise,</l>
<l n="16.174">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.175">"Hence a boat shall come to fetch you,</l>
<l n="16.176">When you shall explain the reason</l>
<l n="16.177">Why to Manala you travel.</l>
<l n="16.178">Though disease has not subdued you.</l>
<l n="16.179">Nor has death thus overcome you,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.181">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.182">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.183">"It was Tuoni brought me hither,</l>

<lg>
<l n="16.185">Tuoni's short and stunted daughter,</l>

<l n="16.187">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.188">"Ay, indeed, I know the liar!</l>
<l n="16.189">If 'twas Tuoni brought you hither,</l>
<l n="16.190">Mana dragged you from your country,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.197">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.198">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

<l n="16.205">For if iron to Mana brought you,</l>
<l n="16.206">Steel to Tuonela had dragged you.</l>
<l n="16.207">From your clothes the blood would trickle,</l>
<l n="16.208">And the blood would forth be flowing.</l>
<l n="16.209">Speak the truth, O Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.210">For the second time speak truly."</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.211">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.212">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.215">Tuoni's short and stunted daughter,</l>
<l n="16.216">She the dwarfish maid of Mana,</l>
<l n="16.217">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

<l n="16.219">If to Mana water brought you,</l>
<l n="16.220">Waves to Manala had floated,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.225">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.226">Gave again a lying answer.</l>
<l n="16.227">"Fire to Tuonela has brought me,</l>
<l n="16.228">Flame to Manala conveyed me."</l>

<l n="16.229">Tuoni's short and stunted daughter.</l>
<l n="16.230">She the dwarfish maid of Mana,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>

<l n="16.237">"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.238">If you wish the boat to fetch you,</l>

<lg>
<l n="16.245">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<l n="16.248">But at length I answer truly.</l>
<l n="16.249">By my art a boat I fashioned,</l>
<l n="16.250">By my songs a boat I builded,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="16.251">And I sang one day, a second,</l>

<l n="16.253">Broke my sledge as I was singing,</l>
<l n="16.254">Broke the shaft as I was singing,</l>
<l n="16.255">So I came for Tuoni's gimlet.</l>
<l n="16.256">Sought in Manala a borer,</l>

<l n="16.258">And with this might form my song-sledge.</l>
<l n="16.259">Therefore bring your boat to this side,</l>
<l n="16.260">Ferry me across the water,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="16.261">And across the straight convey me,</l>
<l n="16.262">Let me come across the river."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.263">Tuonetar abused him roundly,</l>

<l n="16.271">Many truly wander hither,</l>
<l n="16.272">Few return to where they came from!"</l>

<lg>
<l n="16.273">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.274">"This might perhaps deter old women,</l>

<l n="16.278">Row across, O child of Mana!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.279">Brought the boat then, Tuoni's daughter.</l>
<l n="16.280">And the aged Väinämöinen</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="16.281">Quickly o'er the straight she ferried.</l>
<l n="16.282">And across the river rowed him,</l>

<l n="16.285">For thou com'st to Mana living,</l>
<l n="16.286">Com'st to Tuonela undying!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.287">Tuonetar the noble matron,</l>
<l n="16.288">Manalatar, aged woman,</l>
<l n="16.289">Fetched some beer within a tankard,</l>
<l n="16.290">And in both her hands she held it,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="16.291">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.293">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.294">Looked for long within the tankard,</l>
<l n="16.295">And within it frogs were spawning,</l>
<l n="16.296">At the sides the worms were wriggling,</l>
<l n="16.297">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.298">"Surely I have not come hither,</l>
<l n="16.299">Thus to drink from Mana's goblets,</l>
<l n="16.300">Or to drink from Tuoni's tankards.</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="16.301">Those who drink this beer are drunken,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.303">Then said Tuonela's great mistress,</l>
<l n="16.304">"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.305">Why to Manala dost travel,</l>
<l n="16.306">Why to Tuonela hast ventured,</l>
<l n="16.307">Though by Tuoni never summoned,</l>
<l n="16.308">To the land of Mana called not?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.309">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.310">"At my boat as I was working,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="16.311">While my new boat I was shaping,</l>
<l n="16.312">Then I found three words were wanting,</l>
<l n="16.313">Ere the stern could be completed,</l>

<l n="16.315">But as I could find them nowhere,</l>
<l n="16.316">In the world where'er I sought them,</l>
<l n="16.317">Then to Tuonela I travelled,</l>
<l n="16.318">Journeyed to the land of Mana,</l>
<l n="16.319">There to find the words I needed,</l>
<l n="16.320">There the magic words to study."</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.321">Then said Tuonela's great mistress,</l>
<l n="16.322">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.323">"Ne'er the words will Tuoni give you,</l>
<l n="16.324">Nor his spells will Mana teach you.</l>
<l n="16.325">Never shall you leave these regions,</l>
<l n="16.326">Never while your life remaineth,</l>
<l n="16.327">Shall you ever journey homeward,</l>
<l n="16.328">To your country home returning."</l>
</lg>

<l n="16.330">And the traveller lay and slumbered,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="16.331">On the bed prepared by Tuoni,</l>
<l n="16.332">There outstretched himself in slumber,</l>
<l n="16.333">And the hero thus was captured,</l>
<l n="16.334">Lay outstretched, but quickly wakened.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.335">There's in Tuonela a witch-wife,</l>
<l n="16.336">Aged crone with chin projecting,</l>
<l n="16.337">And she spins her thread of iron,</l>
<l n="16.338">And she draws out wire of copper.</l>
<l n="16.339">And she spun of nets a hundred,</l>
<l n="16.340">And she wove herself a thousand,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>

<l n="16.345">And he weaves his nets of iron,</l>
<l n="16.346">And he makes his nets of copper,</l>
<l n="16.347">And a hundred nets he wove him,</l>
<l n="16.348">And a thousand nets he plaited,</l>
<l n="16.349">In the selfsame night of summer,</l>
<l n="16.350">On the same stone in the water.</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.351">Tuoni's son with crooked fingers.</l>
<l n="16.352">Crooked fingers hard as iron,</l>
<l n="16.353">Took the hundred nets, and spread them</l>
<l n="16.354">Right across the stream of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="16.355">Both across and also lengthwise,</l>
<l n="16.356">And in an oblique direction</l>
<l n="16.357">So that Väinö should not 'scape him,</l>
<l n="16.358">Nor should flee Uvantolainen,</l>
<l n="16.359">In the course of all his lifetime,</l>
<l n="16.360">While the golden moon is shining,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>

<lg>
<l n="16.363">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="16.364">Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
<l n="16.365">"May not rain overtake me,</l>
<l n="16.366">And an evil fate await me.</l>
<l n="16.367">Here in Tuonela's dark dwellings,</l>
<l n="16.368">In the foul abode of Mana?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.369">Quickly then his shape transforming,</l>
<l n="16.370">And another shape assuming,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="16.371">To the gloomy lake he hastened;</l>
<l n="16.372">Like an otter in the reed-beds,</l>
<l n="16.373">Like an iron snake he wriggled,</l>
<l n="16.374">Like a little adder hastened</l>
<l n="16.375">Straight across the stream of Tuoni,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.377">Tuoni's son with crooked fingers,</l>
<l n="16.378">Crooked fingers, hard as iron,</l>
<l n="16.379">Wandered early in the morning</l>
<l n="16.380">To survey the nets extended,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="16.381">Found of salmon-trout a hundred,</l>
<l n="16.382">Smaller fry he found by thousands,</l>
<l n="16.383">But he found not Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="16.384">Not the old Uvantolainen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.385">Thus the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="16.386">Made his way from Tuoni's kingdom,</l>
<l n="16.387">And he said the words which follow,</l>
<l n="16.388">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="16.389">"Never, Jumala the mighty,</l>
<l n="16.390">Never let another mortal,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="16.391">Make his way to Mana's country,</l>
<l n="16.392">Penetrate to Tuoni's kingdom!</l>
<l n="16.393">Many there indeed have ventured.</l>
<l n="16.394">Few indeed have wandered homeward;</l>
<l n="16.395">From the dread abode of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="16.396">From the eternal home of Mana."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="16.397">Afterwards these words he added,</l>
<l n="16.398">And expressed himself in thiswise.</l>
<l n="16.399">To the rising generation,</l>
<l n="16.400">And to the courageous people:"</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN AND ANTERO VIPUNEN</head>
<div type="argument">Väinämöinen goes to obtain magic words from Antero Vipunen, and wakes him from his long sleep under the earth (1-98). Vipunen swallows Väinämöinen, and the latter begins to torture him violently in his stomach (99-146). Vipunen tries every means that he can think of to get rid of him by promises, spells, conjurations and exorcisms, but Väinämöinen declares that he will never depart till he has obtained from Vipunen the words which he requires to finish his boat (147-526). Vipunen sings all his wisdom to Väinämöinen, who then leaves his body, returns to his boat-building, and finishes his boat (527-6:28).

<lg>
<l n="17.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

<l n="17.006">In his head reflected ever.</l>
<l n="17.007">Where the words he might discover,</l>
<l n="17.008">And obtain the charms he needed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.009">Once a shepherd came to meet him,</l>
<l n="17.010">And he spoke the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="17.011">"You can find a hundred phrases,</l>

<l n="17.013">Known to Antero Vipunen only,</l>
<l n="17.014">In his monstrous mouth and body.</l>
<l n="17.015">And there is a path which leads there,</l>
<l n="17.016">And a cross-road must be traversed,</l>
<l n="17.017">Not the best among the pathways,</l>
<l n="17.018">Nor the very worst of any.</l>
<l n="17.019">Firstly you must leap along it</l>
<l n="17.020">O'er the points of women's needles,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="17.021">And another stage must traverse</l>
<l n="17.022">O'er the points of heroes' sword-blades,</l>

<l n="17.024">O'er the blades of heroes' axes."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.025">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="17.026">Pondered deeply o'er the journey,</l>
<l n="17.027">To the smithy then he hastened,</l>
<l n="17.028">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.041">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="17.042">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.049">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="17.050">Started on his way, unheeding,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="17.051">And the first day speeded lightly</l>
<l n="17.052">O'er the points of women's needles,</l>

<l n="17.054">O'er the points of heroes' sword-blades,</l>
<l n="17.055">And upon the third day speeded</l>
<l n="17.056">O'er the blades of heroes' axes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.057">Vipunen in songs was famous,</l>
<l n="17.058">Full of craft the aged hero;</l>

<l n="17.061">On his shoulders grew a poplar,</l>

<l n="17.064">On his beard a willow-thicket,</l>
<l n="17.065">On his brow were firs with squirrels,</l>
<l n="17.066">From his teeth sprang branching pine-trees.</l>
<l n="17.067">Then at once did Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="17.068">Draw his sword and free the iron</l>
<l n="17.069">From the scabbard formed of leather,</l>
<l n="17.070">From his belt of lambskin fashioned;"</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="17.071">Fell the poplar from his shoulders,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.077">Then he thrust his stake of iron</l>
<l n="17.078">Into Vipunen's mouth he thrust it,</l>

<l n="17.080">In his clashing jaws he thrust it,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="17.081">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="17.083">Where beneath the earth thou restest,</l>
<l n="17.084">In a sleep that long has lasted."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.085">Vipunen, in songs most famous,</l>
<l n="17.086">Suddenly awoke from slumber,</l>
<l n="17.087">Feeling he was roughly treated,</l>
<l n="17.088">And with pain severe tormented.</l>
<l n="17.089">Then he bit the stake of iron,</l>
<l n="17.090">Bit the outer softer iron,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="17.091">But the steel he could not sever,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.119">So he pondered and reflected</l>

<l n="17.121">In his belt a knife had Väinö,</l>

<l n="17.533">Sang his mighty spells of magic,</l>
<l n="17.534">Chanted forth of all the greatest,</l>
<l n="17.535">Magic songs of the Creation,</l>
<l n="17.536">From the very earliest ages,</l>
<l n="17.537">Songs that all the children sing not,</l>

<l n="17.539">In these dreary days of evil,</l>
<l n="17.540">In the days that now are passing.</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.541">Words of origin he chanted,</l>
<l n="17.542">All his spells he sang in order,</l>
<l n="17.543">At the will of the Creator,</l>
<l n="17.544">At behest of the Almighty,</l>
<l n="17.545">How himself the air he fashioned,</l>
<l n="17.546">And from air the water parted,</l>
<l n="17.547">And the earth was formed from water,</l>
<l n="17.548">And from earth all herbage sprouted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.549">Then he sang the moon's creation,</l>
<l n="17.550">Likewise how the sun was fashioned,</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
<l n="17.551">How the air was raised on pillars,</l>

<l n="17.553">Vipunen, in songs the wisest,</l>
<l n="17.554">Sang in part, and sang in fulness.</l>
<l n="17.555">Never yet was heard or witnessed,</l>

<l n="17.557">One who was a better singer,</l>
<l n="17.558">One who was a wiser wizard.</l>
<l n="17.559">From his mouth the words were flowing,</l>
<l n="17.560">And his tongue sent forth his sayings,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.563">Through the days he sang unceasing,</l>
<l n="17.564">Through the nights without cessation.</l>
<l n="17.565">To his songs the sun gave hearing,</l>
<l n="17.566">And the golden moon stayed listening,</l>
<l n="17.567">Waves stood still on ocean's surface,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.581">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.587">Vipunen then, in songs the wisest,</l>
<l n="17.588">Answered in the words which follow:</l>

<l n="17.600">To his mouth made lengthened journey,</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
<l n="17.601">From the belly of the wise one,</l>
<l n="17.602">From within his monstrous body.</l>
<l n="17.603">From his mouth he glided swiftly,</l>
<l n="17.604">O'er the heath he bounded swiftly,</l>
<l n="17.605">Very like a golden squirrel,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.607">Further on his path he journeyed,</l>
<l n="17.608">Till at length he reached the smithy.</l>

<lg>
<l n="17.615">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="17.621">To his boat he hastened quickly,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN AND ILMARINEN TRAVEL TO POHJOLA</head> <div type="argument">Väinämöinen sets sail in his new boat to woo the Maiden of Pohja (1-40). Ilmarinen's sister sees him, calls to him from the shore, learns the object of his journey, and hastens to warn her brother that a rival has set forth to Pohjola to claim the bride (41-266). Ilmarinen makes ready, and rides on horseback to Pohjola along the shore (267-470). The Mistress of Pohjola sees the suitors approaching, and advises her daughter to choose Väinämöinen (471-634). But the daughter herself prefers Ilmarinen, the forger of the Sampo, and tells Väinämöinen, who is first to arrive, that she will not marry him (635-706).

<l n="18.013">Then upon the morning after,</l>

<l n="18.215">There she found smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.216">He the great primeval craftsman.</l>
<l n="18.217">And he forged a bench of iron,</l>
<l n="18.218">And adorned it all with silver.</l>
<l n="18.219">Cubit-high his head was sooted,</l>
<l n="18.220">On his shoulders ash by fathoms.</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.221">Annikki the door then entered,</l>
<l n="18.222">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="18.223">"Smith and brother Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.224">Thou the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="18.225">Forge me now a weaver's shuttle,</l>
<l n="18.226">Pretty rings to deck my fingers,</l>
<l n="18.227">Golden earrings, two or three pairs,</l>
<l n="18.228">Five or six linked girdles make me,</l>
<l n="18.229">For most weighty truth I'll tell you,</l>
<l n="18.230">All the truth without evasion."</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.231">Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.232">"If you tell me news important,</l>
<l n="18.233">Then a shuttle will I forge you,</l>
<l n="18.234">Pretty rings to deck your fingers,</l>
<l n="18.235">And a cross upon your bosom,</l>
<l n="18.236">And the finest head-dress forge you.</l>
<l n="18.237">If the words you speak are evil,</l>
<l n="18.238">All your ornaments I'll shatter,</l>
<l n="18.239">Tear them off to feed the furnace,</l>
<l n="18.240">And beneath the forge will thrust them."</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.241">Annikki, the ever-famous,</l>
<l n="18.242">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="18.243">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.244">Do you still propose to marry</l>
<l n="18.245">Her, the bride who once was promised,</l>
<l n="18.246">And as wife was pledged unto you?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.247">"While you weld and hammer always,</l>
<l n="18.248">Ever working with your hammer,</l>
<l n="18.249">Making horseshoes in the summer,</l>
<l n="18.250">Iron horseshoes for the winter,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="18.251">Working at your sledge at night-time,</l>
<l n="18.252">And its frame in daytime shaping,</l>
<l n="18.253">Forth to journey to your wooing,</l>
<l n="18.254">And to Pohjola to travel,</l>
<l n="18.255">One more cunning goes before you,</l>
<l n="18.256">And another speeds beyond you,</l>
<l n="18.257">And your own will capture from you,</l>
<l n="18.258">And your love will ravish from you,</l>
<l n="18.259">Whom two years ago thou sawest,</l>
<l n="18.260">Whom two years agone thou wooed'st.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="18.261">Know that Väinämöinen journeys</l>
<l n="18.262">O'er the blue waves of the ocean,</l>
<l n="18.263">In a boat with prow all golden,</l>
<l n="18.264">Steering with his copper rudder,</l>
<l n="18.265">To the gloomy land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="18.266">Sariola, for ever misty."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.267">To the smith came grievous trouble.</l>
<l n="18.268">To the iron-worker sorrow.</l>
<l n="18.269">From his grasp the tongs slid downward,</l>
<l n="18.270">From his hand he dropped the hammer.</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.271">Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.272">"Annikki, my little sister,</l>
<l n="18.273">I will forge you now a shuttle.</l>
<l n="18.274">Pretty rings to deck your fingers,</l>
<l n="18.275">Golden earrings, two or three pairs,</l>
<l n="18.276">Five or six linked girdles make you.</l>
<l n="18.277">Warm for me the pleasant bathroom,</l>
<l n="18.278">Fill the room with fragrant vapour,</l>
<l n="18.279">Let the logs you burn be small ones,</l>
<l n="18.280">And the fire with chips be kindled,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="18.281">And prepare me too some ashes,</l>
<l n="18.282">And some soap in haste provide me,</l>
<l n="18.283">That I wash my head and cleanse it,</l>
<l n="18.284">And I may make white my body</l>
<l n="18.285">From the coal-dust of the autumn,</l>
<l n="18.286">From the forge throughout the winter."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.287">Annikki, whose name was famous,</l>
<l n="18.288">Heated secretly the bathroom,</l>
<l n="18.289">With the boughs the wind had broken,</l>
<l n="18.290">And the thunderbolt had shattered.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="18.291">Stones she gathered from the river,</l>
<l n="18.292">Heated them till they were ready,</l>
<l n="18.293">Cheerfully she fetched the water,</l>
<l n="18.294">From the holy well she brought it,</l>
<l n="18.295">Broke some bath-whisks from the bushes,</l>
<l n="18.296">Charming bath-whisks from the thickets,</l>
<l n="18.297">And she warmed the honeyed bath-whisks,</l>
<l n="18.298">On the honeyed stones she warmed them,</l>
<l n="18.299">Then with milk she mixed the ashes,</l>
<l n="18.300">And she made him soap of marrow,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="18.301">And she worked the soap to lather,</l>
<l n="18.302">Kneaded then the soap to lather,</l>
<l n="18.303">That his head might cleanse the bridegroom,</l>
<l n="18.304">And might cleanse himself completely.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.305">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.306">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="18.307">Wrought the maiden what she wished for,</l>
<l n="18.308">And he wrought a splendid head-dress,</l>
<l n="18.309">While she made the bathroom ready,</l>
<l n="18.310">And she put the bath in order.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="18.311">In her hands he placed the trinkets,</l>
<l n="18.312">And the maiden thus addressed him:</l>
<l n="18.313">"Now the bathroom's filled with vapour,</l>
<l n="18.314">And the vapour-bath I've heated,</l>
<l n="18.315">And have steeped the bath-whisks nicely,</l>
<l n="18.316">Choosing out the best among them.</l>
<l n="18.317">Bathe, O brother, at your pleasures,</l>
<l n="18.318">Pouring water as you need it,</l>
<l n="18.319">Wash your head to flaxen colour,</l>
<l n="18.320">Till your eyes shine out like snowflakes."</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.321">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.322">Went to take the bath he needed,</l>
<l n="18.323">There he bathed himself at pleasure,</l>
<l n="18.324">And he washed himself to whiteness,</l>
<l n="18.325">Washed his eyes until they sparkled,</l>
<l n="18.326">And his temples till they glistened,</l>
<l n="18.327">And his neck to hen's-egg whiteness,</l>
<l n="18.328">And his body all was shining.</l>
<l n="18.329">From the bath the room he entered,</l>
<l n="18.330">Changed so much they scarcely knew him,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="18.331">For his face it shone with beauty,</l>
<l n="18.332">And his cheeks were cleansed and rosy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.333">Then he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="18.334">"Annikki, my little sister,</l>
<l n="18.335">Bring me now a shirt of linen,</l>
<l n="18.336">And the best of raiment bring me,</l>
<l n="18.337">That I robe myself completely,</l>
<l n="18.338">And may deck me like a bridegroom."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.339">Annikki, the ever-famous,</l>
<l n="18.340">Brought him then a shirt of linen,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="18.341">For his limbs no longer sweating,</l>
<l n="18.342">For his body all uncovered.</l>
<l n="18.343">Then she brought well-fitting trousers,</l>
<l n="18.344">Which his mother had been sewing,</l>
<l n="18.345">For his hips, no longer sooty,</l>
<l n="18.346">And his legs were fully covered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.347">Then she brought him finest stockings,</l>
<l n="18.348">Which, as maid, had wove his mother,</l>
<l n="18.349">And with these his shins he covered,</l>
<l n="18.350">And his calves were hidden by them.</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="18.351">Then she brought him shoes that fitted,</l>
<l n="18.352">Best of Saxon boots she brought him,</l>
<l n="18.353">And with these the stockings covered</l>
<l n="18.354">Which his mother sewed as maiden;</l>
<l n="18.355">Then a coat of blue she chose him,</l>
<l n="18.356">With a liver-coloured lining,</l>
<l n="18.357">Covering thus the shirt of linen,</l>
<l n="18.358">Which of finest flax was fashioned,</l>
<l n="18.359">Then an overcoat of woollen,</l>
<l n="18.360">Of four kinds of cloth constructed,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="18.361">O'er the coat of bluish colour,</l>
<l n="18.362">Of the very latest fashion,</l>
<l n="18.363">And a new fur, thousand-buttoned,</l>
<l n="18.364">And a hundredfold more splendid,</l>
<l n="18.365">O'er the overcoat of woollen,</l>
<l n="18.366">And the cloth completely hiding;</l>
<l n="18.367">Round his waist a belt she fastened,</l>
<l n="18.368">And the belt was gold-embroidered,</l>
<l n="18.369">Which his mother wrought as maiden,</l>
<l n="18.370">Wrought it when a fair-haired maiden,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="18.371">Brightly-coloured gloves she brought him,</l>
<l n="18.372">Gold-embroidered, for his fingers,</l>
<l n="18.373">Which the Lapland children fashioned;</l>
<l n="18.374">On his handsome hands he drew them,</l>
<l n="18.375">Then a high-crowned hat she brought him</l>
<l n="18.376">(On his golden locks she placed it)</l>
<l n="18.377">Which his father once had purchased,</l>
<l n="18.378">When as bridegroom he adorned him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.379">Thus the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.380">Clothed himself, and made him ready,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="18.381">Robed himself, and made him handsome,</l>
<l n="18.382">And his servant he commanded:</l>
<l n="18.383">"Yoke me now a rapid courser,</l>
<l n="18.384">In the sledge adorned so finely,</l>
<l n="18.385">That I start upon my journey,</l>
<l n="18.386">And to Pohjola may travel."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.387">Thereupon the servant answered,</l>
<l n="18.388">"Horses six are in the stable,</l>
<l n="18.389">Horses six, on oats that fatten;</l>
<l n="18.390">Which among them shall I yoke you?"</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.391">Said the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.392">"Take the best of all the stallions,</l>
<l n="18.393">Put the foal into the harness,</l>
<l n="18.394">Yoke before the sledge the chestnut,</l>
<l n="18.395">Then provide me with six cuckoos,</l>
<l n="18.396">Seven blue birds at once provide me,</l>
<l n="18.397">That upon the frame they perch them,</l>
<l n="18.398">And may sing their cheerful music,</l>
<l n="18.399">That the fair ones may behold them,</l>
<l n="18.400">And the maidens be delighted.</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
<l n="18.401">Then provide me with a bearskin,</l>
<l n="18.402">That I seat myself upon it,</l>
<l n="18.403">And a second hide of walrus,</l>
<l n="18.404">That the bright-hued sledge is covered."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.405">Thereupon the skilful servant,</l>
<l n="18.406">He the servant paid with wages,</l>
<l n="18.407">Put the colt into the harness,</l>
<l n="18.408">Yoked before the sledge the chestnut,</l>
<l n="18.409">And provided six fine cuckoos,</l>
<l n="18.410">Seven blue birds at once provided,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
<l n="18.411">That upon the frame should perch them,</l>
<l n="18.412">And should sing their cheerful music;</l>
<l n="18.413">And a bearskin next provided,</l>
<l n="18.414">That his lord should sit upon it,</l>
<l n="18.415">And another hide of walrus,</l>
<l n="18.416">And with this the sledge he covered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.417">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.418">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="18.419">Sent aloft his prayer to Ukko,</l>
<l n="18.420">And he thus besought the Thunderer:"</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
<l n="18.421">"Scatter forth thy snow, O Ukko,</l>
<l n="18.422">Let the snowflakes soft be drifted,</l>
<l n="18.423">That the sledge may glide o'er snowfields,</l>
<l n="18.424">O'er the snow-drifts gliding swiftly."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.425">Then the snow did Ukko scatter,</l>
<l n="18.426">And the snowflakes soft were drifted,</l>
<l n="18.427">Till the heath-stems all were covered,</l>
<l n="18.428">On the ground the berry-bushes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.429">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.430">In his sledge of iron sat him,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
<l n="18.431">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="18.432">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="18.433">"On my reins attend good fortune,</l>
<l n="18.434">Jumala my sledge protecting,</l>
<l n="18.435">That my reins good fortune fail not,</l>
<l n="18.436">Nor my sledge may break, O Jumala!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.437">In one hand the reins he gathered,</l>
<l n="18.438">And the whip he grasped with other,</l>
<l n="18.439">O'er the horse the whip he brandished,</l>
<l n="18.440">And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
<l n="18.441">"Whitebrow, speed thou quickly onward,</l>
<l n="18.442">Haste away, O flaxen-maned one."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.443">On the way the horse sprang forward,</l>
<l n="18.444">On the water's sandy margin,</l>
<l n="18.445">By the shores of Sound of Sima,</l>
<l n="18.446">Past the hills with alders covered.</l>
<l n="18.447">On the shore the sledge went rattling,</l>
<l n="18.448">On the beach the shingle clattered.</l>
<l n="18.449">In his eyes the sand was flying,</l>
<l n="18.450">To his breast splashed up the water.</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
<l n="18.451">Thus he drove one day, a second,</l>
<l n="18.452">Drove upon the third day likewise,</l>
<l n="18.453">And at length upon the third day,</l>
<l n="18.454">Overtook old Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="18.455">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="18.456">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="18.457">"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="18.458">Let us make a friendly compact,</l>
<l n="18.459">That although we both are seeking,</l>
<l n="18.460">And we both would woo the maiden,</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
<l n="18.461">Yet by force we will not seize her,</l>
<l n="18.462">Nor against her will shall wed her."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.463">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="18.464">"I will make a friendly compact,</l>
<l n="18.465">That we will not seize the maiden,</l>
<l n="18.466">Nor against her will shall wed her.</l>
<l n="18.467">Let the maiden now be given</l>
<l n="18.468">To the husband whom she chooses,</l>
<l n="18.469">That we nurse not long vexation,</l>
<l n="18.470">Nor a lasting feud be fostered."</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.471">Further on their way they travelled,</l>
<l n="18.472">On the path that each had chosen;</l>
<l n="18.473">Sped the boat, the shore re-echoed,</l>
<l n="18.474">Ran the horse, the earth resounded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.475">But a short time passed thereafter,</l>
<l n="18.476">Very short the time elapsing,</l>
<l n="18.477">Ere the grey-brown dog was barking,</l>
<l n="18.478">And the house-dog loudly baying,</l>
<l n="18.479">In the gloomy land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="18.480">Sariola, for ever cloudy,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="18.481">Sooner still the dog was growling,</l>
<l n="18.482">But with less-continued growling,</l>
<l n="18.483">By the borders of the cornfield,</l>
<l n="18.484">'Gainst the ground his tail was wagging.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.485">Then exclaimed the Lord of Pohja,</l>
<l n="18.486">"Go, my daughter, to discover</l>
<l n="18.487">Why the grey-brown dog is barking,</l>
<l n="18.488">And the long-eared dog is baying."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.489">But the daughter made him answer:</l>
<l n="18.490">"I have not the time, my father,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="18.491">I must clean the largest cowshed,</l>
<l n="18.492">Tend our herd of many cattle,</l>
<l n="18.493">Grind the corn between the millstones,</l>
<l n="18.494">Through the sieve must sift the flour,</l>
<l n="18.495">Grind the corn to finest flour,</l>
<l n="18.496">And the grinder is but feeble."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.497">Gently barked the castle's Hiisi,</l>
<l n="18.498">And again the dog was growling,</l>
<l n="18.499">And again said Pohja's Master:</l>
<l n="18.500">"Go, old dame, and look about you,</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="18.501">See why barks the grey-brown house-dog,</l>
<l n="18.502">Why the castle-dog is growling."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.503">But the old dame made him answer:</l>
<l n="18.504">"This is not a time for talking,</l>
<l n="18.505">For my household cares are heavy,</l>
<l n="18.506">And I must prepare the dinner,</l>
<l n="18.507">And must bake a loaf enormous,</l>
<l n="18.508">And for this the dough be kneading,</l>
<l n="18.509">Bake the loaf of finest flour,</l>
<l n="18.510">And the baker is but feeble."</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.511">Thereupon said Pohja's Master:</l>
<l n="18.512">"Women they are always hurried,</l>
<l n="18.513">And the maidens always busy,</l>
<l n="18.514">When before the stove they roast them,</l>
<l n="18.515">When they in their beds are lying;</l>
<l n="18.516">Son, go you, and look around you."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.517">Thereupon the son made answer:</l>
<l n="18.518">"I've no time to look about me;</l>
<l n="18.519">I must grind the blunted hatchet,</l>
<l n="18.520">Chop a log of wood to pieces,</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
<l n="18.521">Chop to bits the largest wood-pile,</l>
<l n="18.522">And to faggots small reduce it.</l>
<l n="18.523">Large the pile, and small the faggots,</l>
<l n="18.524">And the workman of the weakest."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.525">Still the castle-dog was barking,</l>
<l n="18.526">And the yard-dog still was barking,</l>
<l n="18.527">And the furious whelp was baying,</l>
<l n="18.528">And the island watch-dog howling,</l>
<l n="18.529">Sitting by the furthest cornfield,</l>
<l n="18.530">And his tail was briskly wagging.</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.531">Then again said Pohja's Master,</l>
<l n="18.532">"Not for nought the dog is barking,</l>
<l n="18.533">Never has he barked for nothing,</l>
<l n="18.534">Never growls he at the fir-trees."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.535">So he went to reconnoitre,</l>
<l n="18.536">And he walked across the courtyard,</l>
<l n="18.537">To the cornfield's furthest borders,</l>
<l n="18.538">To the path beyond the ploughed land.</l>
<l n="18.539">Gazed he where the dog's snout pointed,</l>
<l n="18.540">Where he saw his muzzle pointing,</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
<l n="18.541">To the hill where storms are raging,</l>
<l n="18.542">To the hills where grow the alders,</l>
<l n="18.543">Then he saw the truth most clearly,</l>
<l n="18.544">Why the grey-brown dog was barking,</l>
<l n="18.545">And the pride of earth was baying,</l>
<l n="18.546">And the woolly-tailed one howling,</l>
<l n="18.547">For he saw a red boat sailing</l>
<l n="18.548">Out amid the Bay of Lempi,</l>
<l n="18.549">And a handsome sledge was driving</l>
<l n="18.550">On the shore of Sound of Sima.</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.551">After this the Lord of Pohja</l>
<l n="18.552">To the house returned directly,</l>
<l n="18.553">And beneath the roof he hastened,</l>
<l n="18.554">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="18.555">"There are strangers swiftly sailing</l>
<l n="18.556">O'er the blue lake's watery surface,</l>
<l n="18.557">And a gaudy sledge is gliding</l>
<l n="18.558">On the shore of Sound of Sima;</l>

<l n="18.560">To the shore of Bay of Lempi."</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.561">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="18.562">"Whence shall we obtain an omen</l>
<l n="18.563">Why these strangers here are coming?</l>
<l n="18.564">O my little waiting-maiden,</l>
<l n="18.565">On the fire lay rowan-faggots.</l>
<l n="18.566">And the best log in its glowing.</l>
<l n="18.567">If the log with blood is flowing,</l>
<l n="18.568">Then the strangers come for battle,</l>

<l n="18.570">Then is peace abiding with us."</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.571">Then the little maid of Pohja,</l>
<l n="18.572">She, the modest waiting-maiden,</l>
<l n="18.573">On the fire laid rowan-faggots,</l>
<l n="18.574">Placed the best log in its glowing.</l>
<l n="18.575">From the log no blood was trickling,</l>
<l n="18.576">Nor did water trickle from it;</l>
<l n="18.577">From the log there oozed forth honey,</l>
<l n="18.578">From the log dripped down the nectar.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.579">From the corner spoke Suovakko,</l>
<l n="18.580">Spoke the old dame 'neath the blankets:"</l><ref type="line number">580</ref>
<l n="18.581">"From the log if oozes honey,</l>
<l n="18.582">From the log if drips the nectar,</l>
<l n="18.583">Then the strangers who are coming,</l>
<l n="18.584">May be ranked as noble suitors."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.585">Then did Pohja's aged Mistress,</l>
<l n="18.586">Pohja's old dame, Pohja's daughter,</l>
<l n="18.587">To the courtyard fencing hasten,</l>
<l n="18.588">Hurry quick across the courtyard,</l>
<l n="18.589">And they gazed across the water,</l>
<l n="18.590">To the south their heads then turning,</l><ref type="line number">590</ref>
<l n="18.591">And they saw from thence approaching,</l>
<l n="18.592">Swift a ship of novel fashion,</l>
<l n="18.593">Of a hundred planks constructed,</l>
<l n="18.594">Out upon the Bay of Lempi.</l>
<l n="18.595">Underneath the boat looked bluish,</l>
<l n="18.596">But the sails of crimson colour.</l>
<l n="18.597">In the stern there sat a hero,</l>
<l n="18.598">At the copper rudder's handle,</l>
<l n="18.599">And they saw a stallion trotting</l>
<l n="18.600">With a red sledge strange of aspect,</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
<l n="18.601">And the gaudy sledge was speeding</l>
<l n="18.602">On the shore of Sound of Sima,</l>
<l n="18.603">And they saw six golden cuckoos,</l>
<l n="18.604">Perching on the frame, and calling,</l>
<l n="18.605">Seven blue birds were likewise perching</l>
<l n="18.606">On the reins, and these were singing;</l>
<l n="18.607">And a stalwart hero, sitting</l>
<l n="18.608">In the sledge, the reins was holding.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.609">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="18.610">And she spoke the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">610</ref>

<l n="18.625">He with empty hands is coming;</l>
<l n="18.626">Filled his sledge with spells of magic.</l>

<l n="18.627">"Therefore if the room they enter,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.635">But the lovely maid of Pohja,</l>
<l n="18.636">Thus made answer to her mother:</l>
<l n="18.637">"O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="18.638">O my mother who hast reared me,</l>
<l n="18.639">Nothing do I care for riches,</l>
<l n="18.640">Nor a man profound in wisdom,</l><ref type="line number">640</ref>
<l n="18.641">But a man of lofty forehead,</l>
<l n="18.642">One whose every limb is handsome.</l>
<l n="18.643">Never once in former ages,</l>
<l n="18.644">Gave a maid her life in thiswise.</l>
<l n="18.645">I, a maid undowered, will follow</l>
<l n="18.646">Ilmarinen, skilful craftsman,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.649">Then said Pohja's aged Mistress,</l>

<l n="18.651">If you go with Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="18.652">From whose brow the sweat falls freely,</l>
<l n="18.653">You must wash the blacksmith's aprons,</l>
<l n="18.654">And the blacksmith's head wash likewise."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.655">But the daughter gave her answer,</l>
<l n="18.656">In the very words which follow:</l>
<l n="18.657">"Him from Väinölä I choose not,</l>
<l n="18.658">Nor an aged man will care for,</l>
<l n="18.659">For an old man is a nuisance,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="18.661">Then did aged Väinämöinen</l>

<l n="18.667">After this the house he entered,</l>

<l n="18.695">Then the lovely maid of Pohja,</l>

<head>THE EXPLOITS AND BETROTHAL OF ILMARINEN</head>
<div type="argument">Ilmarinen arrives at the homestead of Pohjola, woos the daughter of the house, and perilous tasks are assigned to him (1-32). Aided by the advice of the Maiden of Pohja he succeeds in performing the tasks successfully. Firstly, he ploughs a field of serpent, secondly, he captures the Bear of Tuoni and the Wolf of Manala, and thirdly, he captures a large and terrible pike in the river of Tuonela (33-344). The Mistress of Pohjola promises and betroths her daughter to Ilmarinen (345-498). Väinämöinen returns from Pohjola in low spirits, and warns every one against going wooing in company with a younger man (499-518).

<lg>
<l n="19.001">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.002">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="19.003">Came himself into the chamber,</l>
<l n="19.004">And beneath the roof he hastened.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.005">Brought the maid of mead a beaker,</l>
<l n="19.006">Placed a can of drink of honey</l>
<l n="19.007">In the hands of Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.008">And the smith spoke out as follows:</l>
<l n="19.009">"Never while my life is left me,</l>
<l n="19.010">Long as shines the golden moonlight,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="19.011">Will I taste the drink before me,</l>

<lg>
<l n="19.015">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>

<l n="19.027">Once the field was ploughed by Hiisi,</l>

<l n="19.068">With a belt of steel he girt him,</l>
<l n="19.069">Took a pair of iron gauntlets,</l>

<l n="19.075">There he saw the heads all rearing,</l>

<l n="19.146">In the blue depths of the forest.</l>
<l n="19.147">And he said, returning homeward:</l>
<l n="19.148">"Give me now your daughter, old one.</l>
<l n="19.149">Here I bring the Bear of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.150">And the Wolf of Mana muzzled."</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.151">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="19.152">Answer in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="19.153">"I will give you first the duckling,</l>
<l n="19.154">And the blue-winged duck will give you,</l>
<l n="19.155">When the pike, so huge and scaly,</l>
<l n="19.156">He the fish so plump and floundering.</l>
<l n="19.157">You shall bring from Tuoni's river,</l>
<l n="19.158">And from Manala's abysses;</l>
<l n="19.159">But without a net to lift it,</l>
<l n="19.160">Using not a hand to grasp it.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="19.161">Hundreds have gone forth to seek it,</l>
<l n="19.162">Never one returned in safety."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.163">Then there came distress upon him,</l>
<l n="19.164">And affliction overwhelmed him,</l>
<l n="19.165">As he sought the maiden's chamber,</l>
<l n="19.166">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="19.167">"Now a task is laid upon me,</l>
<l n="19.168">Greater still than all the former;</l>
<l n="19.169">For the pike, so huge and scaly,</l>
<l n="19.170">He the fish so plump and floundering,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="19.171">I must bring from Tuoni's river,</l>
<l n="19.172">From the eternal stream of Mana,</l>
<l n="19.173">But with neither snare nor drag-net,</l>
<l n="19.174">Nor with help of other tackle."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.175">Then his bride assistance lent him,</l>
<l n="19.176">And advice the maiden gave him.</l>
<l n="19.177">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.178">Do thou not be so despondent!</l>
<l n="19.179">Forge thee now a fiery eagle.</l>
<l n="19.180">Forge a bird of fire all flaming!</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="19.181">This the mighty pike shall capture,</l>
<l n="19.182">Drag the fish so plump and floundering,</l>

<l n="19.184">And from Manala's abysses."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.185">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.186">Deathless artist of the smithy,</l>
<l n="19.187">Forged himself a fiery eagle,</l>
<l n="19.188">Forged a bird of fire all flaming,</l>
<l n="19.189">And of iron he forged the talons,</l>
<l n="19.190">Forged the claws of steel the hardest,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="19.191">Wings like sides of boat constructed;</l>
<l n="19.192">Then upon the wings he mounted,</l>
<l n="19.193">On the eagle's back he sat him,</l>
<l n="19.194">On the wing-bones of the eagle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.195">Then he spoke unto the eagle,</l>
<l n="19.196">And the mighty bird instructed:</l>
<l n="19.197">"O my eagle, bird I fashioned,</l>
<l n="19.198">Fly thou forth, where I shall order,</l>
<l n="19.199">To the turbid stream of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.200">And to Manala's abysses:</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="19.201">Seize the pike, so huge and scaly,</l>
<l n="19.202">He the fish so plump and floundering."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.203">Then the bird, that noble eagle,</l>
<l n="19.204">Took his flight, and upward soarings,</l>
<l n="19.205">Forth he flew the pike to capture,</l>
<l n="19.206">Fish with teeth of size terrific,</l>
<l n="19.207">In the river-depths of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.208">Down in Manala's abysses:</l>
<l n="19.209">To the water stretched a pinion,</l>
<l n="19.210">And the other touched the heavens;</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="19.211">In the sea he dipped his talons,</l>
<l n="19.212">On the cliffs his beak he whetted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.213">Thus the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.214">Journeyed forth to seek his booty</l>
<l n="19.215">In the depths of Tuoni's river,</l>
<l n="19.216">While the eagle watched beside him.</l>
<l n="19.217">From the water rose a kelpie</l>
<l n="19.218">And it clutched at Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.219">By the neck the eagle seized it,</l>
<l n="19.220">And the kelpie's head he twisted.</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="19.221">To the bottom down he forced it,</l>
<l n="19.222">To the black mud at the bottom.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.223">Then came forth the pike of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.224">And the water-dog came onward.</l>
<l n="19.225">Not a small pike of the smallest,</l>
<l n="19.226">Nor a large pike of the largest;</l>
<l n="19.227">Long his tongue as twain of axe-shafts,</l>
<l n="19.228">Long his teeth as rake-shaft measures,</l>
<l n="19.229">Wide his gorge as three great rivers,</l>
<l n="19.230">Seven boats' length his back extended,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="19.231">And the smith he sought to seize on,</l>
<l n="19.232">And to swallow Ilmarinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.233">But the eagle rushed against him,</l>
<l n="19.234">And the bird of air attacked him;</l>
<l n="19.235">Not an eagle of the small ones,</l>
<l n="19.236">Nor an eagle of the large ones.</l>
<l n="19.237">Long his beak as hundred fathoms,</l>
<l n="19.238">Wide his gorge as six great rivers,</l>
<l n="19.239">Six spears' length his tongue extended,</l>
<l n="19.240">Five scythes' length his talons measured</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="19.241">And he saw the pike so scaly,</l>
<l n="19.242">Saw the fish so plump and floundering.</l>
<l n="19.243">Fiercely on the fish he darted,</l>
<l n="19.244">Rushed against the fish so scaly.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.245">Then the pike so large and scaly,</l>
<l n="19.246">He the fish so plump and floundering,</l>
<l n="19.247">Tried to drag the eagle's pinions</l>
<l n="19.248">Underneath the sparkling waters,</l>
<l n="19.249">But the eagle swift ascended,</l>
<l n="19.250">Up into the air he raised him,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="19.251">From the grimy ooze he raised him,</l>
<l n="19.252">To the sparkling water o'er it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.253">Back and forth the eagle hovered,</l>
<l n="19.254">And again he made an effort,</l>
<l n="19.255">And he struck one talon fiercely</l>
<l n="19.256">In the pike's terrific shoulders,</l>
<l n="19.257">In the water-dog's great backbone,</l>
<l n="19.258">And he fixed the other talon</l>
<l n="19.259">Firmly in the steel-hard mountain,</l>
<l n="19.260">In the rocks as hard as iron.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="19.261">From the stone slipped off the talon,</l>
<l n="19.262">Slipped from off the rocky mountain,</l>
<l n="19.263">And the pike again dived downward,</l>
<l n="19.264">In the water slid the monster,</l>
<l n="19.265">Slipped from off the eagle's talons,</l>
<l n="19.266">From the great bird's claws terrific,</l>
<l n="19.267">But his sides were scored most deeply,</l>
<l n="19.268">And his shoulders cleft asunder.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.269">Once again, with iron talons,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="19.270">Swooped again the furious eagle,</l>
<l n="19.271">With his wings all fiery glowing,</l>
<l n="19.272">And his eyes like flame that sparkled,</l>
<l n="19.273">Seized the pike with mighty talons,</l>
<l n="19.274">Grasped the water-dog securely,</l>
<l n="19.275">Dragged the huge and scaly monster,</l>
<l n="19.276">Raised him from the tossing water,</l>
<l n="19.277">From the depths beneath the billows,</l>
<l n="19.278">To the water's sparkling surface.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.279">Then the bird with claws of iron</l>
<l n="19.280">Made a third and final effort,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="19.281">Brought the mighty pike of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.282">He the fish so plump and floundering,</l>
<l n="19.283">From the river dark of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.284">And from Manala's abysses.</l>
<l n="19.285">Scarce like water flowed the water</l>
<l n="19.286">From the great pike's scales stupendous;</l>
<l n="19.287">Nor like air the air extended</l>
<l n="19.288">When the great bird flapped his pinions.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.289">Thus the iron-taloned eagle</l>
<l n="19.290">Bore the pike so huge and scaly,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="19.291">To the branches of an oak-tree,</l>
<l n="19.292">To a pine-tree's crown, wide spreading.</l>
<l n="19.293">There he feasted on the booty,</l>
<l n="19.294">Open ripped the fish's belly,</l>
<l n="19.295">Tore away the fish's breastbone,</l>
<l n="19.296">And the head and neck he sundered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.297">Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.298">"O thou wicked, wicked eagle,</l>
<l n="19.299">What a faithless bird I find you,</l>
<l n="19.300">You have seized upon the quarry,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="19.301">And you have feasted on the booty,</l>
<l n="19.302">Open ripped the fish's belly,</l>
<l n="19.303">Torn away the fish's breastbone,</l>
<l n="19.304">And the head and neck have sundered."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.305">But the iron-taloned eagle</l>
<l n="19.306">Rose and soared away in fury,</l>
<l n="19.307">High aloft in air he raised him,</l>
<l n="19.308">To the borders of the cloudland.</l>
<l n="19.309">Fled the clouds, the heavens were thundering,</l>
<l n="19.310">And the props of air bowed downward:</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="19.311">Ukko's bow in twain was broken,</l>
<l n="19.312">In the moon the horns sharp-pointed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.313">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.314">Took the pike's head, which he carried,</l>
<l n="19.315">To the old crone as a present,</l>
<l n="19.316">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="19.317">"Make of this a chair for ever,</l>
<l n="19.318">In the halls of lofty Pohja."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.319">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="19.320">And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="19.321">"I have ploughed the field of serpents,</l>
<l n="19.322">Furrowed all the land of serpents;</l>
<l n="19.323">Bridled, too, the wolves of Mana,</l>
<l n="19.324">And have chained the bears of Tuoni;</l>
<l n="19.325">Brought the pike so huge and scaly,</l>
<l n="19.326">He the fish so plump and floundering,</l>
<l n="19.327">From the river deep of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="19.328">And from Manala's abysses.</l>
<l n="19.329">Will you give me now the maiden,</l>
<l n="19.330">And bestow your daughter on me?"</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.331">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="19.332">"Badly have you done your errand,</l>
<l n="19.333">Thus the head in twain to sever,</l>
<l n="19.334">Open rip the fish's belly,</l>
<l n="19.335">Tear away the fish's breastbone,</l>
<l n="19.336">Feasting thus upon the booty."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.337">Then the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="19.338">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="19.339">"Never can you bring, undamaged,</l>
<l n="19.340">Quarry from the best of regions.</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="19.341">This is brought from Tuoni's river,</l>

<l n="19.344">She for whom I longed and laboured?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.345">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="19.346">Answer in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="19.347">"Yes, the maiden now is ready.</l>
<l n="19.348">She for whom you longed and laboured.</l>
<l n="19.349">I will give my tender duckling,</l>
<l n="19.350">And prepare the duck I cherished,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="19.351">For the smith, for Ilmarinen,</l>

<l n="19.354">Dove-like in his arms to nestle."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.355">On the floor a child was sitting,</l>
<l n="19.356">On the floor a child was singing:</l>
<l n="19.357">"To our room there came already,</l>
<l n="19.358">Came a bird into our castle;</l>
<l n="19.359">From the north-east flew an eagle,</l>

<l n="19.361">In the air one wing was flapping,</l>
<l n="19.362">On the sea the other rested,</l>
<l n="19.363">With his tail he swept the ocean,</l>
<l n="19.364">And to heaven his head he lifted;</l>
<l n="19.365">And he gazed around, and turned him,</l>
<l n="19.366">Back and forth the eagle hovered,</l>
<l n="19.367">Perched upon the heroes' castle,</l>
<l n="19.368">And his beak he whetted on it,</l>

<l n="19.383">"Then he perched upon the chimney,</l>
<l n="19.384">Then upon the floor descended,</l>
<l n="19.385">Pushed aside the castle's shutter,</l>
<l n="19.386">Sat him at the castle window,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.407">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="19.408">Answer in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="19.409">"Wherefore dost thou know, my darling,</l>

<l n="19.466">Have I not for ever told thee,</l>
<l n="19.467">Not to sing among the pine-trees,</l>
<l n="19.468">Not to sing amid the valleys,</l>
<l n="19.469">Not to arch thy neck too proudly,</l>

<lg>
<l n="19.473">"I have warned thee all the autumn,</l>
<l n="19.474">And besought thee all the summer,</l>
<l n="19.475">Likewise in the spring have cautioned,</l>
<l n="19.476">At the second springtide sowing,</l>
<l n="19.477">To construct a secret dwelling,</l>
<l n="19.478">With the windows small and hidden,</l>
<l n="19.479">Where the maids may do their weaving,</l>

<l n="19.481">All unheard by Suomi's gallants,</l>
<l n="19.482">Suomi's gallants, country lovers."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.483">From the floor the child made answer,</l>
<l n="19.484">And the fortnight-old responded:</l>
<l n="19.485">"Easily a horse is hidden</l>
<l n="19.486">In the stall, with fine-tailed horses;</l>
<l n="19.487">Hard it is to hide a maiden,</l>
<l n="19.488">And to keep her long locks hidden.</l>
<l n="19.489">Though you build of stone a castle,</l>
<l n="19.490">And amid the sea shall rear it,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="19.491">Though you keep your maidens in it,</l>
<l n="19.492">And should rear your darlings in it,</l>
<l n="19.493">Still the girls cannot be hidden,</l>
<l n="19.494">Nor attain their perfect stature,</l>
<l n="19.495">Undisturbed by lusty gallants,</l>
<l n="19.496">Lusty gallants, country lovers.</l>
<l n="19.497">Mighty men, with lofty helmets,</l>
<l n="19.498">Men who shoe with steel their horses."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.499">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="19.500">Head bowed down, and deeply grieving:"</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="19.501">Wandered on his journey homeward,</l>
<l n="19.502">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="19.503">"Woe is me, a wretched creature,</l>
<l n="19.504">That I did not learn it sooner,</l>
<l n="19.505">That In youthful days one weddeth,</l>
<l n="19.506">And must choose a life-companion.</l>
<l n="19.507">All thing else a man may grieve for,</l>
<l n="19.508">Save indeed an early marriage,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="19.511">Thus did warn old Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="19.512">Cautioned thus Suvantolainen,</l>
<l n="19.513">That old men against the younger,</l>
<l n="19.514">Should not struggle for a fair one:</l>
<l n="19.515">Warned them not to swim too proudly,</l>
<l n="19.516">Neither try to race in rowing,</l>
<l n="19.517">Nor to seek to woo a maiden,</l>

<lg>
<l n="20.017">In Carelia grew a bullock,</l>
<l n="20.018">Fat the ox they reared in Suomi,</l>
<l n="20.019">Not a large one, not a small one,</l>

<l n="20.029">Striving through the space to hasten,</l>
<l n="20.030">Nor found resting-place between them;</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="20.031">Month-long ran a summer-squirrel</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.035">'Twas this calf of size stupendous,</l>

<l n="20.038">Till they reached the fields of Pohja.</l>
<l n="20.039">By his horns, a hundred led him,</l>
<l n="20.040">And a thousand dragged his muzzle,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="20.041">And they led the ox still further,</l>
<l n="20.042">Till to Pohjola they brought him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.043">On his road the ox proceeded</l>
<l n="20.044">By the Sound of Sariola strayed;</l>
<l n="20.045">Browsed the grass in marshy places,</l>
<l n="20.046">While his back the clouds were touching;</l>
<l n="20.047">But they could not find a butcher,</l>
<l n="20.048">Who could fell the country's marvel</l>
<l n="20.049">On the list of Suomi's children,</l>
<l n="20.050">'Mid the mighty host of people,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>

<lg>
<l n="20.053">From afar an old man journeyed</l>
<l n="20.054">Virokannas from Carelia;</l>
<l n="20.055">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="20.060">Never in another summer,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="20.061">Would you turn about your muzzle,</l>

<l n="20.063">Here among the fields of Pohja,</l>
<l n="20.064">By the Sound of Sariola stray."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.065">Then the old man went to strike him,</l>
<l n="20.066">Virokannas moved against him,</l>
<l n="20.067">Went to slay the ox unhappy;</l>
<l n="20.068">But his head the ox was turning,</l>
<l n="20.069">And his black eyes he was blinking.</l>
<l n="20.070">To a pine-tree sprang the old man,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="20.071">Virokannas in the bushes,</l>
<l n="20.072">In the scrubby willow-thicket.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.073">After this they sought a butcher,</l>
<l n="20.074">Who the mighty ox could slaughter,</l>
<l n="20.075">From Carelia's lovely country,</l>
<l n="20.076">From the vast expanse of Suomi,</l>
<l n="20.077">From the peaceful land of Russia,</l>
<l n="20.078">From the hardy land of Sweden,</l>

<l n="20.080">From the mighty land of Turja,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="20.081">And they sought through Tuoni's regions,</l>
<l n="20.082">In the depths of Mana's kingdom,</l>
<l n="20.083">And they sought, but no one found they,</l>
<l n="20.084">Long they searched; but vainly searched they.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.085">Yet again they sought a butcher,</l>
<l n="20.086">Sought again to find a slaughterer,</l>
<l n="20.087">On the ocean's shining surface,</l>
<l n="20.088">On the wide-extending billows.</l>
<l n="20.089">From the dark sea rose a hero,</l>
<l n="20.090">Rose a hero from the sea-swell,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="20.091">From the shining surface rising,</l>
<l n="20.092">From the wide expanse of water.</l>
<l n="20.093">He was not among the greatest,</l>
<l n="20.094">But in nowise of the smallest.</l>
<l n="20.095">In a bowl would he lie sleeping,</l>
<l n="20.096">And beneath a sieve stand upright.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.097">'Twas an old man, iron-fisted,</l>
<l n="20.098">Iron-coloured, too, to gaze on;</l>
<l n="20.099">On his head a stony helmet;</l>
<l n="20.100">Shoes of stone his feet protected;</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="20.101">In his hand a knife, gold-bladed,</l>
<l n="20.102">And the haft o'erlaid with copper.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.103">Thus the people found a butcher,</l>
<l n="20.104">And at length they found a slaughterer,</l>
<l n="20.105">Who should fell the bull of Suomi,</l>
<l n="20.106">And should fell the country's marvel.</l>
<l n="20.107">Scarce had he beheld the quarry,</l>
<l n="20.108">Than at once his neck he shattered,</l>
<l n="20.109">On his knees he forced the bullock,</l>
<l n="20.110">And upon his side he threw him.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="20.111">Did he yield them much provisions?</l>
<l n="20.112">Not so very much he yielded.</l>
<l n="20.113">Of his flesh a hundred barrels,</l>
<l n="20.114">And a hundred fathoms sausage;</l>
<l n="20.115">Seven boat-loads of blood they gathered,</l>
<l n="20.116">Six large casks with fat were loaded,</l>
<l n="20.117">All for Pohjola's great banquet,</l>
<l n="20.118">Feast of Sariola the misty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.119">Then they built a house in Pohja,</l>
<l n="20.120">Built a house with hall enormous,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="20.121">Fathoms nine its sides extended,</l>
<l n="20.122">And the breadth thereof was seven.</l>
<l n="20.123">If a cock crowed at the smoke-hole,</l>
<l n="20.124">Underneath they could not hear it,</l>
<l n="20.125">If a dog at end was barking,</l>
<l n="20.126">At the door they did not hear it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.127">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="20.128">Walk across the flooring's planking,</l>
<l n="20.129">To the middle of the chamber,</l>
<l n="20.130">And she pondered and reflected:"</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="20.131">"How shall I get ale sufficient,</l>
<l n="20.132">And shall brew the beer most wisely,</l>
<l n="20.133">To prepare it for the wedding,</l>
<l n="20.134">When the beer will much be needed?</l>
<l n="20.135">How to brew the beer I know not,</l>
<l n="20.136">Nor how ale was first concocted."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.137">By the stove there sat an old man,</l>
<l n="20.138">From the stove spoke up the old man:</l>
<l n="20.139">"Ale of barley is concocted,</l>
<l n="20.140">And the drink with hops is flavoured,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="20.141">Yet they brew not save with water,</l>
<l n="20.142">And the aid of furious fire.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.143">"Hop is called the son of Revel;</l>
<l n="20.144">Planted in the ground when little,</l>
<l n="20.145">With a plough they ploughed the region,</l>
<l n="20.146">Like an ant, away they cast him</l>
<l n="20.147">Close to Kaleva's great well-spring,</l>
<l n="20.148">There where Osmo's field is sloping;</l>
<l n="20.149">There the tender plant sprang upward,</l>
<l n="20.150">And the green shoot mounted quickly.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="20.151">Up a little tree it mounted,</l>
<l n="20.152">Rising to the leafy summit.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.153">"Sowed, by chance, an old man barley,</l>
<l n="20.154">In the fresh-ploughed field of Osmo,</l>
<l n="20.155">And the barley sprouted bravely,</l>
<l n="20.156">And It grew and flourished greatly,</l>
<l n="20.157">On the new-ploughed field of Osmo,</l>
<l n="20.158">Kaleva's descendant's cornland.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.159">"But a little time passed over,</l>
<l n="20.160">When the hops exclaimed from tree-top,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="20.161">And upon the field the barley,</l>
<l n="20.162">And in Kaleva's well-water,</l>
<l n="20.163">'When shall we be yoked together,</l>
<l n="20.164">Each with other be united?</l>

<l n="20.168">She, the maid who beer concocted,</l>

<l n="20.171">Seven hop-tassels next she gathered,</l>

<l n="20.173">Then upon the fire she placed it,</l>
<l n="20.174">And allowed it there to simmer,</l>
<l n="20.175">And she boiled the ale of barley</l>
<l n="20.176">Through the fleeting days of summer,</l>
<l n="20.177">Out upon the cloudy headland,</l>

<l n="20.410">'Tis the best of ale for drinking;</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
<l n="20.411">If into the casks you pour it,</l>

<lg>
<l n="20.425">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>

<l n="20.431">And the ale began she brewing,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.435">'Twas for months the stones were glowing,</l>
<l n="20.436">And for summers water boiling,</l>
<l n="20.437">Trees were burning on the islands,</l>
<l n="20.438">Water from the wells was carried.</l>
<l n="20.439">Bare of trees they left the islands,</l>
<l n="20.440">And the lakes were greatly shrunken,</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
<l n="20.441">For the ale was in the barrels,</l>
<l n="20.442">And the beer was stored securely</l>
<l n="20.443">For the mighty feast of Pohja,</l>
<l n="20.444">For carousing at the mansion.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.445">From the island smoke was rising,</l>
<l n="20.446">On the headland fire was glowing;</l>
<l n="20.447">Thick the clouds of smoke were rising,</l>
<l n="20.448">In the air there rose the vapour.</l>
<l n="20.449">For the fire was burning fiercely,</l>
<l n="20.450">And the fire was brightly glowing,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
<l n="20.451">Half it filled the land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="20.452">Over all Carelia spreading.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.453">All the people gazed upon it,</l>
<l n="20.454">Gazed, and then they asked each other,</l>
<l n="20.455">"Wherefore is the smoke arising,</l>
<l n="20.456">In the air the vapour rising?</l>
<l n="20.457">'Tis too small for smoke of battle,</l>
<l n="20.458">'Tis too large for herdsman's bonfire."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.459">Then rose Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="20.460">At the earliest dawn of morning,</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
<l n="20.461">And she went to fetch some water.</l>
<l n="20.462">Clouds of smoke she saw arising,</l>
<l n="20.463">Up from Pohjola's dominions,</l>
<l n="20.464">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="20.465">"Perhaps it is the smoke of combat,</l>
<l n="20.466">Perhaps it is the fire of battle."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.467">Ahti, dweller on the island,</l>
<l n="20.468">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="20.469">Wandered round and gazed about him,</l>
<l n="20.470">And he pondered and reflected,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
<l n="20.471">"I must go and look upon it,</l>
<l n="20.472">From a nearer spot examine,</l>
<l n="20.473">Whence the smoke is thus ascending</l>
<l n="20.474">Filling all the air with vapour,</l>
<l n="20.475">If it be the smoke of combat,</l>
<l n="20.476">If it be the fire of battle."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.477">Kauko went to gaze about him,</l>
<l n="20.478">And to learn whence smoke was rising,</l>
<l n="20.479">But it was not fire of battle,</l>
<l n="20.480">Neither was it fire of combat,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="20.481">But 'twas fire where ale was brewing,</l>
<l n="20.482">Likewise where the beer was brewing,</l>
<l n="20.483">Near where Sound of Sariola spreads,</l>
<l n="20.484">Out upon the jutting headland.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.485">Then did Kauko gaze around him,</l>
<l n="20.486">And one eye he rolled obliquely,</l>
<l n="20.487">And he squinted with the other,</l>
<l n="20.488">And his mouth he pursed up slowly,</l>
<l n="20.489">And at last he spoke, while gazing,</l>
<l n="20.490">And across the sound he shouted,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="20.491">"O my dearest foster-mother,</l>
<l n="20.492">Pohjola's most gracious Mistress!</l>
<l n="20.493">Brew thou ale of extra goodness,</l>
<l n="20.494">Brew thou beer the best of any,</l>

<l n="20.498">With thy young and lovely daughter."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.499">Now the ale was quite fermented,</l>
<l n="20.500">And the drink of men was ripened,</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="20.501">And the red ale stored they safely,</l>
<l n="20.502">And the good beer stored securely.</l>
<l n="20.503">Underneath the ground they stored it,</l>
<l n="20.504">Stored it in the rocky cellars,</l>
<l n="20.505">In the casks of oak constructed,</l>
<l n="20.506">And behind the taps of copper.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.507">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="20.508">All the food provide for feasting,</l>
<l n="20.509">And the kettles all were singing,</l>
<l n="20.510">And the stewpans all were hissing,</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
<l n="20.511">And large loaves of bread were baking,</l>
<l n="20.512">And she stirred great pots of porridge,</l>
<l n="20.513">Thus to feed the crowds of people,</l>
<l n="20.514">At the banquet at the mansion,</l>
<l n="20.515">At the mighty feast of Pohja,</l>
<l n="20.516">The carouse at Sariola dim.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.517">Now the bread they baked was ready,</l>
<l n="20.518">And were stirred the pots of porridges,</l>
<l n="20.519">And a little time passed over,</l>
<l n="20.520">Very little time passed over,</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
<l n="20.521">When the ale worked in the barrels,</l>
<l n="20.522">And the beer foamed in the cellars,</l>
<l n="20.523">"Now must some one come to drink me,</l>
<l n="20.524">Now must some one come to taste me,</l>
<l n="20.525">That my fame may be reported,</l>
<l n="20.526">And that they may sing my praises."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.527">Then they went to seek a minstrel,</l>
<l n="20.528">Went to seek a famous singer,</l>
<l n="20.529">One whose voice was of the strongest,</l>
<l n="20.530">One who knew the finest legends.</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
<l n="20.531">First to sing they tried a salmon,</l>
<l n="20.532">If the voice of trout was strongest;</l>
<l n="20.533">Singing is not work for salmon,</l>
<l n="20.534">And the pike recites no legends.</l>
<l n="20.535">Crooked are the jaws of salmon,</l>
<l n="20.536">And the teeth of pike spread widely.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.537">Yet again they sought a singer,</l>
<l n="20.538">Went to seek a famous singer,</l>
<l n="20.539">One whose voice was of the strongest,</l>
<l n="20.540">One who knew the finest legends,</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
<l n="20.541">And they took a child for singer,</l>
<l n="20.542">Thought a boy might sing the strongest.</l>
<l n="20.543">Singing is not work for children.</l>
<l n="20.544">Nor are splutterers fit for shouting.</l>
<l n="20.545">Crooked are the tongues of children,</l>
<l n="20.546">And the roots thereof are crooked.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.547">Then the red ale grew indignant,</l>
<l n="20.548">And the fresh drink fell to cursing,</l>
<l n="20.549">Pent within the oaken barrels,</l>
<l n="20.550">And behind the taps of copper.</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
<l n="20.551">"If you do not find a minstrel,</l>

<l n="20.556">And among the dust will trickle."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.557">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="20.558">Send the guests their invitations,</l>
<l n="20.559">Sent her messengers to journey,</l>
<l n="20.560">And she spoke the words which follow:"</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="20.581">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="20.582">In these very words make answer:</l>

<l n="20.585">He is always quick to quarrel,</l>
<l n="20.586">And to fight is always ready.</l>
<l n="20.587">And at weddings works he mischief,</l>
<l n="20.588">And at banquets grievous scandal,</l>

<l n="20.597">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>

<head>THE WEDDING FEAST AT POHJOLA</head>
<div type="argument">The bridegroom and his party are received at Pohjola (1-226). The guests are hospitably entertained with abundance of food and drink (227-252). Väinämöinen sings and praises the people of the house (253-438). 
</div>
<lg>
<l n="21.001">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="21.002">Crone of Sariola the misty,</l>
<l n="21.003">Sometimes out of doors employ her,</l>
<l n="21.004">Sometimes in the house was busied;</l>
<l n="21.005">And she heard how whips were cracking,</l>
<l n="21.006">On the shore heard sledges rattling,</l>
<l n="21.007">And her eyes she turned to northward,</l>
<l n="21.008">Towards the sun her head then turning,</l>
<l n="21.009">And she pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="21.010">"Wherefore are these people coming"</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="21.011">On my shore, to me unhappy?</l>
<l n="21.012">Is it perhaps a hostile army?"</l>

<lg>
<l n="21.013">So she went to gaze around her,</l>
<l n="21.014">And observe the portent nearer;</l>

<l n="21.018">With a mighty host of people.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.019">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>

<l n="21.024">And a faggot-stack overthrowing,</l>
<l n="21.025">On the beach the billows breaking,</l>

<l n="21.027">So I went to gaze around me,</l>
<l n="21.028">And observe the portent nearer;</l>
<l n="21.029">But I found no wind was blowing,</l>
<l n="21.030">Nor the faggot-stack was falling,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="21.031">On the beach no waves were breaking,</l>
<l n="21.032">On the strand no shingle rattling.</l>

<l n="21.036">In the concourse of the people?</l>
<l n="21.037">He is known among the people,</l>
<l n="21.038">As in clumps of trees the cherry,</l>
<l n="21.039">Like an oak-tree in the thickets,</l>
<l n="21.040">Or the moon, 'mid stars in heaven.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>

<lg>
<l n="21.041">"Black the steed that he is driving;</l>
<l n="21.042">Which a ravenous wolf resembles;</l>
<l n="21.043">Or a raven, keen for quarry,</l>
<l n="21.044">Or a lark, with fluttering pinions.</l>
<l n="21.045">Six there are of golden song-birds,</l>
<l n="21.046">On his shafts all sweetly singing,</l>
<l n="21.047">And of blue birds, seven are singing</l>
<l n="21.048">Sitting on the sledge's traces."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.049">From the road was heard a clatter,</l>
<l n="21.050">Past the well the runners rattled,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="21.051">In the court arrived the bridegroom,</l>
<l n="21.052">In the yard the people with him,</l>
<l n="21.053">In the midst appeared the bridegroom,</l>
<l n="21.054">With the greatest of the party.</l>
<l n="21.055">He was not the first among them,</l>

<l n="21.063">Then the bridegroom's horse sped onward,</l>

<l n="21.065">Through the courtyard of the Master,</l>
<l n="21.066">When said Pohjola's old Mistress:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.083">"Lead the bridegroom's horse to water,</l>

<lg>

<l n="21.175">Then the house the bridegroom entered,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.291">On the floor a child was sitting,</l>
<l n="21.292">On the stove-bench sat a milkbeard,</l>
<l n="21.293">From the floor exclaimed the infant,</l>
<l n="21.294">And the boy spoke from the stove-bench:</l>
<l n="21.295">"I am not in years a father,</l>
<l n="21.296">Undeveloped yet my body,</l>
<l n="21.297">But however small I may be,</l>
<l n="21.298">If the other big ones sing not,</l>
<l n="21.299">And the stouter men will shout not,</l>
<l n="21.300">And the rosier cheeked will sing not,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="21.301">Then I'll sing, although a lean boy,</l>
<l n="21.302">Though a thin boy, I will whistle,</l>
<l n="21.303">I will sing, though weak and meagre,</l>
<l n="21.304">Though my stomach is not rounded,</l>
<l n="21.305">That the evening may be cheerful,</l>
<l n="21.306">And the day may be more honoured."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.307">By the stove there sat an old man,</l>
<l n="21.308">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="21.309">"That the children sing befits not,</l>
<l n="21.310">Nor these feeble folk should carol.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="21.311">Children's songs are only falsehoods,</l>
<l n="21.312">And the songs of girls are foolish.</l>
<l n="21.313">Let the wisest sing among us,</l>
<l n="21.314">Who upon the bench is seated."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.315">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="21.316">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="21.317">"Are there any who are youthful,</l>
<l n="21.318">Of the noblest of the people,</l>
<l n="21.319">Who will clasp their hands together,</l>
<l n="21.320">Hook their hands in one another,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="21.321">And begin to speak unto us,</l>
<l n="21.322">Swaying back and forth in singing,</l>
<l n="21.323">That the day may be more joyful,</l>
<l n="21.324">And the evening be more blessed?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.325">From the stove there spoke the old man,</l>
<l n="21.326">"Never was it heard among us,</l>
<l n="21.327">Never heard or seen among us,</l>
<l n="21.328">Nor so long as time existed,</l>
<l n="21.329">That there lived a better minstrel,</l>
<l n="21.330">One more skilled in all enchantment,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="21.331">Than myself when I was warbling,</l>
<l n="21.332">As a child when I was singing,</l>
<l n="21.333">Singing sweetly by the water,</l>
<l n="21.334">Making all the heath re-echo,</l>
<l n="21.335">Chanting loudly in the firwood,</l>
<l n="21.336">Talking likewise In the forest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.337">"Then my voice was loud and tuneful,</l>
<l n="21.338">And its tones were most melodious,</l>
<l n="21.339">Like the flowing of a river,</l>
<l n="21.340">Or the murmur of a streamlet,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="21.341">Gliding as o'er snow the snowshoes,</l>
<l n="21.342">Like a yacht across the billows;</l>
<l n="21.343">But 'tis hard for me to tell you</l>
<l n="21.344">How my wisdom has departed,</l>
<l n="21.345">How my voice so strong has failed me,</l>
<l n="21.346">And its sweetness has departed.</l>
<l n="21.347">Now it flows no more like river,</l>
<l n="21.348">Rising like the tossing billows,</l>
<l n="21.349">But it halts like rake in stubble,</l>
<l n="21.350">Like the hoe among the pine-roots,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="21.351">Like a sledge in sand embedded,</l>
<l n="21.352">Or a boat on rocks when stranded."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.353">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="21.354">In such words as these expressed him:</l>
<l n="21.355">"If no other bard comes forward</l>
<l n="21.356">To accompany my singing,</l>
<l n="21.357">Then alone my songs I'll carol,</l>
<l n="21.358">And will now commence my singing,</l>
<l n="21.359">For to sing was I created,</l>
<l n="21.360">As an orator was fashioned;"</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="21.361">How, I ask not in the village,</l>
<l n="21.362">Nor I learn my songs from strangers."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.363">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="21.364">Of the song the lifelong pillar,</l>
<l n="21.365">Set him to the pleasant labour,</l>
<l n="21.366">Girt him for the toil of singing,</l>
<l n="21.367">Loud he sang his songs so pleasing,</l>
<l n="21.368">Loud he spoke his words of wisdom.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.369">Sang the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="21.370">Sang by turns, and spoke his wisdom,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="21.371">Nor did words that suited fall him,</l>
<l n="21.372">Neither were his songs exhausted,</l>
<l n="21.373">Sooner stones in rocks were missing,</l>
<l n="21.374">Or a pond lacked water-lilies.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.375">Therefore thus sang Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="21.376">Through the evening for their pleasure,</l>
<l n="21.377">And the women all were laughing,</l>
<l n="21.378">And the men in high good-humour,</l>
<l n="21.379">While they listened and they wondered</l>
<l n="21.380">At the chants of Väinämöinen,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="21.381">For amazement filled the hearers,</l>
<l n="21.382">Wonder those who heard him singing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="21.383">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="21.384">When at length his song he ended,</l>
<l n="21.385">"This is what I have accomplished</l>
<l n="21.386">As a singer and magician,</l>
<l n="21.387">Little can I thus accomplish,</l>
<l n="21.388">And my efforts lead me nowhere:</l>

<l n="21.390">Speaking with his mouth of sweetness,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="21.391">He would sing his songs unto you,</l>

<head>THE TORMENTING OF THE BRIDE</head>
<div type="argument">The bride is prepared for her journey and is reminded of her past life and of the altered life that now lies before her (1-124). She becomes very sorrowful (125-184). They bring her to weeping (185-382). She weeps (383-448). They comfort her (449-522).

<div type="argument">The bride is instructed and directed how to conduct herself in her husband's house (1-478). An old vagrant woman relates the experiences of her life as a daughter, as a wife, and after her separation from her husband (479-850).

<lg>
<l n="23.627">"Thus did I, a girl unhappy,</l>
<l n="23.628">Work at proper time for working,</l>

<l n="23.637">Evil words they heaped upon me,</l>

<l n="23.657">"Then in words I spoke my feelings,</l>

<l n="23.664">In a very evil station,</l>
<l n="23.665">In a very bad position,</l>
<l n="23.666">'Mid the hard roots of a birch-tree,</l>

<l n="23.703">In his hand a stick of cherry,</l>
<l n="23.704">'Neath his arm a club he carried,</l>

<l n="23.707">"When the evening came thereafter,</l>
<l n="23.708">And there came the time for sleeping,</l>
<l n="23.709">At his side a rod he carried,</l>

<l n="23.721">"From his cold side then I raised me,</l>

<l n="24.487">Lured her with a little money,</l>
<l n="24.488">And enticed her with his silver.</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="24.497">But the smith, e'en Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="24.498">With the young girl hastened homeward,</l>
<l n="24.499">Driving rattling on his journey,</l>

<l n="24.501">By the shore of Sound of Sima.</l>

<l n="24.503">Shingle crashed, and sand was shaking,</l>
<l n="24.504">Swayed the sledge, the pathway rattled,</l>
<l n="24.505">Loudly rang the iron runners,</l>
<l n="24.506">And the frame of birch resounded,</l>
<l n="24.507">And the curving laths were rattling,</l>
<l n="24.508">Shaking was the cherry collar,</l>
<l n="24.509">And the whiplash whistling loudly,</l>
<l n="24.510">And the rings of copper shaking,</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
<l n="24.511">As the noble horse sprang forward,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="24.513">Drove the smith one day, a second,</l>
<l n="24.514">Driving likewise on the third day;</l>
<l n="24.515">With one hand the horse he guided,</l>
<l n="24.516">And with one embraced the damsel,</l>
<l n="24.517">One foot on the sledge-side rested,</l>
<l n="24.518">Underneath the rug the other.</l>
<l n="24.519">Quick they sped, and fast they journeyed,</l>
<l n="24.520">And at length upon the third day</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
<l n="24.521">Just about the time of sunset,</l>
<l n="24.522">Hove in sight the smith's fair dwelling</l>
<l n="24.523">And they came to Ilma's homestead,</l>
<l n="24.524">And the smoke in streaks ascended,</l>
<l n="24.525">And the smoke rose thickly upward,</l>
<l n="24.526">From the house in wreaths arising,</l>
<l n="24.527">Up amid the clouds ascending.</l>

<head>THE HOME-COMING OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM</head> <div type="argument">The bride, the bridegroom and their company are received at the home of Ilmarinen (1-382). The company are hospitably entertained with food and drink: and Väinämöinen sings the praises of the host, the hostess, the inviter, the bridesmaid, and the other wedding-guests (383-672). On the way back Väinämöinen's sledge breaks down, but he repairs it, and drives home (673-738).

<lg>
<l n="25.001">Long already 'twas expected,</l>
<l n="25.002">Long expected and awaited,</l>
<l n="25.003">That the new bride soon would enter</l>

<l n="25.007">And the young folks' knees were failing</l>
<l n="25.008">As about the door they waited,</l>
<l n="25.009">And the children's feet were freezing,</l>
<l n="25.010">By the wall as they were standing,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="25.011">Mid-aged folks their shoes were spoiling,</l>
<l n="25.012">As upon the beach they wandered.</l>

<lg>
<l n="25.013">And at length upon a morning,</l>
<l n="25.014">Just about the time of sunrise,</l>
<l n="25.015">From the wood they heard a rattling,</l>
<l n="25.016">As the sledge came rushing onward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.017">Lokka then the kindest hostess,</l>
<l n="25.018">Kaleva's most handsome matron,</l>
<l n="25.019">Uttered then the words which follow:</l>

<l n="25.520">I will praise our gracious hostess,</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
<l n="25.521">She who has prepared the banquet,</l>
<l n="25.522">And has filled the table for us.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.523">"Large the loaves that she has baked us,</l>
<l n="25.524">And she stirred us up thick porridge,</l>
<l n="25.525">With her hands that move so quickly,</l>
<l n="25.526">With her soft and tenfold fingers,</l>
<l n="25.527">And she let the bread rise slowly,</l>
<l n="25.528">And the guests with speed she feasted;</l>
<l n="25.529">Pork she gave them in abundance,</l>
<l n="25.530">Gave them cakes piled up in dishes,</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
<l n="25.531">And the knives were duly sharpened,</l>
<l n="25.532">And the pointed blades pressed downward,</l>
<l n="25.533">As the salmon were divided,</l>
<l n="25.534">And the pike were split asunder.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.535">"Often has our noble mistress,</l>
<l n="25.536">She the most accomplished housewife,</l>
<l n="25.537">Risen up before the cockcrow,</l>
<l n="25.538">And before the hen's son hastened,</l>
<l n="25.539">That she might prepare the needful,</l>
<l n="25.540">That the work might all be finished,</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
<l n="25.541">That the beer might be concocted,</l>
<l n="25.542">And the ale be ready for us.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.543">"Well indeed our noble hostess,</l>
<l n="25.544">And this most accomplished housewife,</l>
<l n="25.545">Best of ale for us concocted,</l>
<l n="25.546">And the finest drink set flowing.</l>
<l n="25.547">'Tis composed of malted barley,</l>
<l n="25.548">And of malt the very sweetest,</l>
<l n="25.549">And with wood she has not turned it,</l>
<l n="25.550">With a stake she has not moved it,</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
<l n="25.551">Only with her hands has raised it,</l>
<l n="25.552">Only with her arms has turned it,</l>
<l n="25.553">In the bathroom filled with vapour,</l>
<l n="25.554">On the boarding, scoured so cleanly.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.555">"Nor did she, our noble hostess,</l>
<l n="25.556">And this most accomplished mistress,</l>
<l n="25.557">Let the germs mature them fully,</l>
<l n="25.558">While on ground the malt was lying.</l>
<l n="25.559">Oft she went into the bathroom,</l>
<l n="25.560">Went alone, at dead of midnight,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
<l n="25.561">Fearing not the wolf should harm her,</l>
<l n="25.562">Nor the wild beasts of the forest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.563">"Now that we have praised the hostess,</l>
<l n="25.564">Let us also praise the inviter;</l>
<l n="25.565">Who was chosen as inviter,</l>
<l n="25.566">And upon the road to guide us?</l>
<l n="25.567">Best inviter of the village,</l>
<l n="25.568">Best of guides in all the village.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.569">"There we look on our inviter,</l>
<l n="25.570">Clad in coat from foreign countries;</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
<l n="25.571">Round his arms 'tis tightly fitted,</l>
<l n="25.572">Neatly round his waist 'tis fitted.</l>

<lg>
<l n="25.573">"There we look on our inviter,</l>
<l n="25.574">In a narrow cloak attired;</l>
<l n="25.575">On the sand the skirts are sweeping,</l>
<l n="25.576">On the ground the train is sweeping.</l>
<l n="25.577">Of his shirt we see a little,</l>
<l n="25.578">Only see a very little,</l>
<l n="25.579">As if Kuutar's self had wove it,</l>
<l n="25.580">And the tin-adorned one wrought it.</l><ref type="line number">580</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.581">"Here we look on our inviter,</l>
<l n="25.582">Belted with a belt of woollen,</l>
<l n="25.583">Woven by the Sun's fair daughter,</l>
<l n="25.584">By her beauteous fingers broidered,</l>
<l n="25.585">In the times ere fire existed,</l>
<l n="25.586">And when all unknown was fire.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.587">"Here we look on our inviter,</l>
<l n="25.588">With his feet in silken stockings,</l>
<l n="25.589">And with silk are bound his stockings,</l>
<l n="25.590">And his garters are of satin,</l><ref type="line number">590</ref>
<l n="25.591">And with gold are all embroidered.</l>
<l n="25.592">And are all adorned with silver.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.593">"Here we look on our inviter,</l>
<l n="25.594">Best of Saxon shoes he's wearing,</l>
<l n="25.595">Like the swans upon the river,</l>
<l n="25.596">Or the ducks that swim beside them,</l>
<l n="25.597">Or the geese among the thickets,</l>
<l n="25.598">Birds of passage in the forests.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.599">"Here we look on our inviter,</l>
<l n="25.600">With his golden locks all curling,</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
<l n="25.601">And his golden beard is plaited,</l>
<l n="25.602">On his head a lofty helmet:</l>
<l n="25.603">Up among the clouds it rises,</l>
<l n="25.604">Through the forest's glancing summit;</l>
<l n="25.605">Such a one you could not purchase</l>
<l n="25.606">For a hundred marks or thousand.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.607">"Now that I have praised the inviter,</l>
<l n="25.608">I will also praise the bridesmaid.</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.615">"No, she came from other regions,</l>

<l n="25.617">Thence has come to us the bridesmaid,</l>
<l n="25.618">Thence was she, the happiest, chosen,</l>
<l n="25.619">Brought to us across the water,</l>
<l n="25.620">And across the open ocean.</l><ref type="line number">620</ref>

<lg>
<l n="25.621">"No, she came from other regions,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.629">"And the bridesmaid's mouth is pretty,</l>
<l n="25.630">As the spindle used in Suomi,</l><ref type="line number">630</ref>
<l n="25.631">And the bridesmaid's eyes are sparkling,</l>
<l n="25.632">As the stars that shine in heaven,</l>
<l n="25.633">Gleaming are the damsel's temples,</l>
<l n="25.634">As upon the lake the moonlight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.635">"Here we look upon our bridesmaid;</l>

<lg>
<l n="25.643">"And I thought the moon was shining,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.649">"Now that I have praised the bridesmaid,</l>
<l n="25.650">I will glance at all the people;</l><ref type="line number">650</ref>

<l n="25.658">Nor in future times will happen,</l>
<l n="25.659">That we meet so fine a household,</l>

<l n="25.661">Where the old folks are so stately,</l>

<lg>
<l n="25.667">"Easy to obtain was silver,</l>
<l n="25.668">Gold among the guests was scattered,</l>
<l n="25.669">In the grass were littered purses,</l>
<l n="25.670">In the lanes were bags of money,</l><ref type="line number">670</ref>
<l n="25.671">For the guests who were invited,</l>
<l n="25.672">For the guests most greatly honoured."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.673">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="25.674">Of the song the mighty pillar,</l>
<l n="25.675">After this his sledge ascended,</l>
<l n="25.676">Homeward drove upon his journey,</l>
<l n="25.677">And he sang his songs for ever,</l>
<l n="25.678">Sang, and chanted spells of magic,</l>
<l n="25.679">Sang a song, and sang a second,</l>
<l n="25.680">But, as he the third was singing,</l><ref type="line number">680</ref>
<l n="25.681">Clashed against a rock the runners,</l>
<l n="25.682">Crashed the shafts against a tree-stump,</l>
<l n="25.683">And the sledge broke off his chanting,</l>
<l n="25.684">And the runners stopped his singing,</l>
<l n="25.685">And the shafts in fragments shattered,</l>
<l n="25.686">And the boards broke all asunder.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.687">Spoke the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="25.688">In the very words which follow,</l>
<l n="25.689">"Are there none among the youthful,</l>
<l n="25.690">Of the rising generation,</l><ref type="line number">690</ref>
<l n="25.691">Or perchance among the aged,</l>
<l n="25.692">Of the sinking generation,</l>
<l n="25.693">Who to Tuonela can wander,</l>
<l n="25.694">And can go to Mana's country,</l>
<l n="25.695">Thence to fetch me Tuoni's auger,</l>
<l n="25.696">Bring me Mana's mighty auger,</l>
<l n="25.697">That a new sledge I may fashion,</l>
<l n="25.698">Or repair my sledge that's broken?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.699">But said all the younger people,</l>
<l n="25.700">And the aged people answered:"</l><ref type="line number">700</ref>
<l n="25.701">"There are none among the youthful,</l>
<l n="25.702">None at all among the aged,</l>
<l n="25.703">None of race so highly noble,</l>
<l n="25.704">None is such a mighty hero,</l>
<l n="25.705">As to Tuonela to travel,</l>
<l n="25.706">Journey to the land of Mana,</l>
<l n="25.707">Thence to bring you Tuoni's auger,</l>
<l n="25.708">And from Mana's home to bring it,</l>

<lg>
<l n="25.711">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="25.712">He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
<l n="25.713">Went again to Tuoni's country,</l>
<l n="25.714">Journeyed to the home of Mana,</l>
<l n="25.715">Fetched from Tuonela the auger,</l>
<l n="25.716">Brought from Mana's home the auger.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25.717">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="25.718">Sang a blue wood up before him,</l>
<l n="25.719">In the forest rose an oak-tree,</l>
<l n="25.720">And a splendid mountain-ashtree,</l><ref type="line number">720</ref>
<l n="25.721">And from these a sledge he fashioned,</l>
<l n="25.722">And he shaped his runners from them,</l>
<l n="25.723">And for shafts prepared them likewise,</l>
<l n="25.724">And the frame he thus constructed,</l>
<l n="25.725">Made a sledge to suit his purpose,</l>
<l n="25.726">And a new sledge he constructed.</l>
<l n="25.727">In the shafts the horse he harnessed,</l>
<l n="25.728">Yoked before the sledge the chestnut,</l>
<l n="25.729">In the sledge himself he seated,</l>
<l n="25.730">And upon the seat he sat him,</l><ref type="line number">730</ref>
<l n="25.731">And without the whip the courser,</l>
<l n="25.732">Sped, by beaded whip unharassed,</l>
<l n="25.733">To his long-accustomed fodder,</l>
<l n="25.734">To the food that waited for him,</l>
<l n="25.735">And he brought old Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="25.736">He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
<l n="25.737">To his own door, widely open,</l>
<l n="25.738">To the threshold brought him safely.</l>
