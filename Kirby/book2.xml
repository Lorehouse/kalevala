        <head>LEMMINKAINEN'S JOURNEY TO POHJOLA</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Lemminkainen, greatly offended that he was not invited to the wedding, resolves to go to Pohjola, although his mother dissuades him from it, and warns him of the many dangers that he will have to encounter (1-382). He sets forth and succeeds in passing all the dangerous places by his skill in magic (383-776).

        <lg>
        <l>Ahti dwelt upon an island,</l>
        <l>By the bay near Kauko's headland,</l>
        <l>And his fields he tilled industrious,</l>
        <l>And the fields he trenched with ploughing,</l>
        <l>And his ears were of the finest,</l>
        <l>And his hearing of the keenest.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Heard he shouting in the village,</l>
        <l>From the lake came sounds of hammering,</l>
        <l>On the ice the sound of footsteps,</l>
        <l>On the heath a sledge was rattling,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>Therefore in his mind he fancied,</l>
        <l>In his brain the notion entered,</l>
        <l>That at Pohjola was wedding,</l>
        <l>And a drinking-bout in secret.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Mouth and head awry then twisting,</l>
        <l>And his black beard all disordered,</l>
        <l>In his rage the blood departed</l>
        <l>From the cheeks of him unhappy,</l>
        <l>And at once he left his ploughing,</l>
        <l>'Mid the field he left the ploughshare,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>On the spot his horse he mounted,</l>
        <l>And he rode directly homeward,</l>
        <l>To his dearest mother's dwelling,</l>
        <l>To his dear and aged mother.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And he said as he approached her,</l>
        <l>And he called, as he was coming,</l>
        <l>"O my mother, aged woman,</l>
        <l>Bring thou food, and bring it quickly,</l>
        <l>That the hungry man may eat it,</l>
        <l>And the moody man devour it,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        <l>While they warm the bathroom for me,</l>
        <l>And the bathroom set in order,</l>
        <l>That the man may wash and cleanse him,</l>
        <l>And adorn him like a hero.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>Bring him food, and bring it quickly,</l>
        <l>That the hungry man might eat it,</l>
        <l>And the moody man devour it,</l>
        <l>While they put the bath in order,</l>
        <l>And arranged the bathroom for him.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Quickly ate the food she gave him,</l>
        <l>Hurried then into the bathroom,</l>
        <l>Hastened quickly to the bathroom,</l>
        <l>There it was the finch now washed him,</l>
        <l>There the bullfinch washed and cleansed him,</l>
        <l>Washed his head to flaxen whiteness,</l>
        <l>And his throat to shining whiteness.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the bath the room he entered,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>"O my mother, aged woman,</l>
        <l>Seek the storehouse on the mountain,</l>
        <l>Bring me thence my shirt, the fine one,</l>
        <l>Likewise bring the finest clothing,</l>
        <l>That I now may put it on me,</l>
        <l>And may fitly clothe me in it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But his mother asked him quickly,</l>
        <l>Asked him thus, the aged woman,</l>
        <l>"Whither goes my son, my dearest,</l>
        <l>Dost thou go to hunt the lynxes,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>Or to chase the elk on snowshoes,</l>
        <l>Or perchance to shoot a squirrel?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>Not to hunt the lynx I wander,</l>
        <l>Nor to chase the elk on snowshoes,</l>
        <l>Neither go I squirrel shooting,</l>
        <l>But I seek the feast at Pohja,</l>
        <l>And the secret drinking-party,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>Therefore fetch my shirt, the fine one,</l>
        <l>Bring me, too, the finest clothing,</l>
        <l>That I hasten to the wedding,</l>
        <l>And may wander to the banquet.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But his mother would forbid him,</l>
        <l>Vainly would his wife dissuade him,</l>
        <l>Two, whose like were not created,</l>
        <l>And three daughters of Creation,</l>
        <l>Sought to hold back Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Back from Pohjola's great banquet.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To her son then said the mother,</l>
        <l>And her child advised the old one,</l>
        <l>"Do not go, my son my dearest,</l>
        <l>O my dearest son, my Kauko,</l>
        <l>Go not to the feast at Pohja,</l>
        <l>To that mansion's drinking-party,</l>
        <l>For indeed they did not ask you,</l>
        <l>And 'tis plain they do not want you.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>"Only bad men go for asking;</l>
        <l>Uninvited good men dance there.</l>
        <l>There are always invitations,</l>
        <l>Always a sufficient summons,</l>
        <l>In the sword with blade of sharpness,</l>
        <l>And the edge so brightly flashing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Still did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
        <l>Do her utmost to restrain him.</l>
        <l>"Go not, son, to sure destruction,</l>
        <l>Unto Pohjola's great banquet.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>Full of terrors is thy journey,</l>
        <l>On thy way are mighty wonders,</l>
        <l>Thrice indeed doth death await thee;</l>
        <l>Thrice the man with death is threatened.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Death is only for the women,</l>
        <l>Everywhere they see destruction;</l>
        <l>But a hero need not fear it,</l>
        <l>Nor need take extreme precautions.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>But let this be as it may be,</l>
        <l>Tell me that my ears may hear it,</l>
        <l>Tell me the first death that waits me,</l>
        <l>Tell the first and tell the last one.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>Answered then, the aged woman:</l>
        <l>"I will tell the deaths that wait you,</l>
        <l>Not as you would have me tell them;</l>
        <l>Of the first death I will tell you,</l>
        <l>And this death is first among them.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>When a little way you've travelled</l>
        <l>On the first day of your journey,</l>
        <l>You will reach a fiery river,</l>
        <l>Flaming right across your pathway,</l>
        <l>In the stream a cataract fiery,</l>
        <l>In the fall a fiery island,</l>
        <l>On the isle a peak all fiery,</l>
        <l>On the peak a fiery eagle,</l>
        <l>One who whets his beak at night-time,</l>
        <l>And his claws in daytime sharpens,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>For the strangers who are coming,</l>
        <l>And the people who approach him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"This is perhaps a death for women,</l>
        <l>But 'tis not a death for heroes.</l>
        <l>For I know a plan already,</l>
        <l>And a splendid scheme to follow.</l>
        <l>I'll create, by songs of magic,</l>
        <l>Both a man and horse of alder.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>They shall walk along beside me,</l>
        <l>And shall wander on before me,</l>
        <l>While I like a duck am diving,</l>
        <l>Like a scoter duck am diving,</l>
        <l>'Neath the soaring eagle's talons,</l>
        <l>Talons of the mighty eagle.</l>
        <l>O my mother, who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>Tell me now of death the second.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"Such the second death that waits you:</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>When a little way you've journeyed,</l>
        <l>On the second day of travel,</l>
        <l>You will reach a trench of fire,</l>
        <l>Right across the path extending,</l>
        <l>Ever to the east extending,</l>
        <l>North-west endlessly extending,</l>
        <l>Full of stones to redness heated,</l>
        <l>Full of blocks of stone all glowing,</l>
        <l>And a hundred there have ventured,</l>
        <l>And a thousand there have perished,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Hundreds with their swords have perished,</l>
        <l>And a thousand steel-clad heroes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Such a death no man will perish,</l>
        <l>Nor is this a death for heroes,</l>
        <l>For I know a trick already,</l>
        <l>Know a trick, and see a refuge;</l>
        <l>And a man of snow I'll sing me,</l>
        <l>Make of frozen snow a hero,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>Push him in the raging fire,</l>
        <l>Push him in the glowing torment,</l>
        <l>Bathe him in the glowing bathroom,</l>
        <l>With a bath-whisk made of copper,</l>
        <l>I myself behind him pressing,</l>
        <l>Pushing through the fire a pathway,</l>
        <l>That my beard unburnt remaineth,</l>
        <l>And my locks escape a singeing.</l>
        <l>O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>Of the third death tell me truly."</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"Such the third death that awaits you:</l>
        <l>When you've gone a little further,</l>
        <l>And another day have travelled,</l>
        <l>Unto Pohjola's dread gateway,</l>
        <l>Where the pathway is the narrowest,</l>
        <l>Then a wolf will rush upon you,</l>
        <l>And a bear for his companion,</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's dread gateway,</l>
        <l>Where the pathway is the narrowest.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>Hundreds have been there devoured,</l>
        <l>Heroes have by thousands perished;</l>
        <l>Wherefore should they not devour thee,</l>
        <l>Kill thee likewise, unprotected?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Perhaps a young ewe might be eaten,</l>
        <l>Or a lamb be torn to pieces,</l>
        <l>Not a man, how weak soever,</l>
        <l>Not the sleepiest of the heroes!</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>With a hero's belt I'm girded,</l>
        <l>And I wear a hero's armour,</l>
        <l>Fixed with buckles of a hero,</l>
        <l>So be sure I shall not hasten,</l>
        <l>Unto Untamo's dread wolf's jaws,</l>
        <l>In the throat of that curst creature.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"'Gainst the wolf I know a refuge,</l>
        <l>'Gainst the bear I know a method;</l>
        <l>For the wolfs mouth sing a muzzle,</l>
        <l>For the bear sing iron fetters,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>Or to very chaff will chop them,</l>
        <l>Or to merest dust will sift them;</l>
        <l>Thus I'll clear the path before me,</l>
        <l>Reach the ending of my journey.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"Even yet your goal you reach not,</l>
        <l>There are still upon your pathway,</l>
        <l>On your road tremendous marvels.</l>
        <l>Three terrific dangers wait you,</l>
        <l>Three more deaths await the hero;</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>And there even yet await you,</l>
        <l>On the spot the worst of marvels.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"When a little way you've travelled,</l>
        <l>Up to Pohjola's enclosure,</l>
        <l>There a fence is reared of iron,</l>
        <l>And a fence of steel erected,</l>
        <l>From the ground to heaven ascending,</l>
        <l>From the heavens to earth descending.</l>
        <l>Spears they are which form the hedgestakes,</l>
        <l>And for wattles, creeping serpents,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Thus the fence with snakes is wattled,</l>
        <l>And among them there are lizards,</l>
        <l>And their tails are always waving,</l>
        <l>And their thick heads always swelling,</l>
        <l>And their round heads always hissing,</l>
        <l>Heads turned out, and tails turned inwards.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"On the ground are other serpents,</l>
        <l>On the path are snakes and adders,</l>
        <l>And above, their tongues are hissing,</l>
        <l>And below, their tails are waving.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>One of all the most terrific</l>
        <l>Lies before the gate across it,</l>
        <l>Longer is he than a roof-tree,</l>
        <l>Than the roof-props is he thicker,</l>
        <l>And above, his tongue is hissing,</l>
        <l>And above, his mouth is hissing,</l>
        <l>Lifted not against another,</l>
        <l>Threatening thee, O luckless hero!.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>"Such a death is perhaps for children;</l>
        <l>But 'tis not a death for heroes,</l>
        <l>For I can enchant the fire,</l>
        <l>And can quench a glowing furnace,</l>
        <l>And can ban away the serpents,</l>
        <l>Twist the snakes between my fingers.</l>
        <l>Only yesterday it happened</l>
        <l>That I ploughed a field of adders;</l>
        <l>On the ground the snakes were twisting,</l>
        <l>And my hands were all uncovered.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>With my nails I seized the vipers,</l>
        <l>In my hands I took the serpents,</l>
        <l>Ten I killed among the vipers,</l>
        <l>And the serpents black by hundreds.</l>
        <l>Still my nails are stained with snake-blood,</l>
        <l>And my hands with slime of serpents.</l>
        <l>Therefore will I not permit me,</l>
        <l>And by no means will I journey</l>
        <l>As a mouthful for the serpents,</l>
        <l>To the sharp fangs of the adders.</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>I myself will crush the monsters,</l>
        <l>Crush the nasty things to pieces,</l>
        <l>And will sing away the vipers,</l>
        <l>Drive the serpents from my pathway,</l>
        <l>Enter then the yard of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And into the house will force me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"O my son, forbear to venture,</l>
        <l>Into Pohjola's dread castle,</l>
        <l>House of Sariola all timbered;</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>For the men with swords are girded,</l>
        <l>Heroes all equipped for battle,</l>
        <l>Men with drink of hops excited,</l>
        <l>Very furious from their drinking.</l>
        <l>They will sing thee, most unhappy,</l>
        <l>To the swords of all the keenest;</l>
        <l>Better men their songs have vanquished,</l>
        <l>Mighty ones been overpowered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>"Well, but I have dwelt already</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's dread fortress.</l>
        <l>Not a Lapp with spells shall chain me,</l>
        <l>Forth no son of Turja drive me.</l>
        <l>I'll enchant the Lapp by singing,</l>
        <l>Drive away the son of Turja,</l>
        <l>And in twain will sing his shoulders,</l>
        <l>From his chin his speech I'll sever,</l>
        <l>Tear his shirt apart by singing,</l>
        <l>And I'll break in two his breastbone."</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"O alas, my son unhappy,</l>
        <l>Dost thou think of former exploits,</l>
        <l>Brag'st thou of thy former journey?</l>
        <l>True it is thou hast resided</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's dread fortress,</l>
        <l>But they sent thee all a-swimming,</l>
        <l>Floating overgrown with pond-weed,</l>
        <l>O'er the raging cataract driven,</l>
        <l>Down the stream in rushing waters.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>Thou hast known the Falls of Tuoni,</l>
        <l>Manala's dread stream hast measured,</l>
        <l>There would'st thou to-day be swimming,</l>
        <l>But for thine unhappy mother.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Listen now to what I tell thee.</l>
        <l>When to Pohjola thou comest,</l>
        <l>All the slope with stakes is bristling,</l>
        <l>And the yard with poles is bristling,</l>
        <l>All with heads of men surmounted,</l>
        <l>And one stake alone is vacant,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>And to fill the stake remaining,</l>
        <l>Will they cut thy head from off thee.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
        <l>"Let a weakling ponder o'er it,</l>
        <l>Let the worthless find such ending!</l>
        <l>After five or six years' warfare,</l>
        <l>Seven long summers spent in battle,</l>
        <l>Not a hero would concern him,</l>
        <l>Nor retire a step before it.</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>Therefore bring me now my mail-shirt,</l>
        <l>And my well-tried battle armour;</l>
        <l>I my father's sword will fetch me,</l>
        <l>And my father's sword-blade look to.</l>
        <l>In the cold it long was lying,</l>
        <l>In a dark place long was hidden;</l>
        <l>There has it been ever weeping,</l>
        <l>For a hero who should wield it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon he took his mail-shirt,</l>
        <l>Took his well-tried battle armour,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>And his father's trusty weapon,</l>
        <l>Sword his father always wielded,</l>
        <l>And against the ground he thrust it,</l>
        <l>On the floor the point he rested,</l>
        <l>With his hand the sword he bended</l>
        <l>Like the fresh crown of the cherry,</l>
        <l>Or the juniper when growing.</l>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"Hard 'twill be in Pohja's castle,</l>
        <l>Rooms of Sariola the misty,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
        <l>Such a sword as this to gaze on,</l>
        <l>Such a sword-blade to encounter.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the wall his bow he lifted,</l>
        <l>From the peg he took a strong bow,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
        <l>"I would hold the man deserving,</l>
        <l>And regard him as a hero,</l>
        <l>Who to bend this bow was able,</l>
        <l>And could bend it and could string it,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
        <l>There in Pohjola's great castle,</l>
        <l>Rooms of Sariola the misty.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Put his shirt of mail upon him,</l>
        <l>Clad himself in arms of battle,</l>
        <l>And his slave he thus commanded,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O my servant, bought with money,</l>
        <l>Workman, whom I got for money,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>Harness now my horse of battle,</l>
        <l>Harness me my fiery war-horse,</l>
        <l>That unto the feast I journey,</l>
        <l>Drinking-bout at house of Lempo.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the prudent slave, obedient,</l>
        <l>Hastened quickly to the courtyard,</l>
        <l>And the foal at once he harnessed,</l>
        <l>And prepared the fiery red one,</l>
        <l>And he said on his returning,</l>
        <l>"I have done what you commanded,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>And the horse have harnessed for you,</l>
        <l>And the best of foals have harnessed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Thought him ready for his journey,</l>
        <l>Right hand urging, left restraining,</l>
        <l>And his sinewy fingers smarting,</l>
        <l>Now would start, and then reflected,</l>
        <l>Started then in reckless fashion.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then her son his mother counselled,</l>
        <l>Warned her child, the aged woman,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
        <l>At the door, beneath the rafters,</l>
        <l>At the place where stand the kettles.</l>
        <l>"O my only son, my dearest,</l>
        <l>O my child, of all the strongest,</l>
        <l>When thou com'st to the carousal,</l>
        <l>And thou comest where thou wishest,</l>
        <l>Drink thou half a goblet only,</l>
        <l>Drink the measure to the middle,</l>
        <l>And the other half return thou;</l>
        <l>Give the worst half to a worse one.</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        <l>In the goblet rests a serpent,</l>
        <l>And a worm within the measure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Yet again her son she cautioned,</l>
        <l>To her child again gave warning,</l>
        <l>At the last field's furthest limit,</l>
        <l>At the last of all the gateways.</l>
        <l>"When thou com'st to the carousal,</l>
        <l>And thou comest where thou wishest,</l>
        <l>Sit upon a half-seat only,</l>
        <l>Step thou with a half-step only,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
        <l>And the other half return thou;</l>
        <l>Give the worst half to a worse one,</l>
        <l>Thus wilt thou a man be reckoned,</l>
        <l>And a most illustrious hero,</l>
        <l>And through armies push thy pathway,</l>
        <l>And will crush them down beneath thee,</l>
        <l>In the press of mighty heroes,</l>
        <l>In the throng of men of valour.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then departed Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>When the horse in sledge was harnessed.</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
        <l>With his ready whip he struck him,</l>
        <l>With his beaded whip he smote him,</l>
        <l>And the fiery steed sprang forward,</l>
        <l>Onward sped the rapid courser.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When a short way he had journeyed,</l>
        <l>For about an hour had travelled,</l>
        <l>There he saw a flock of blackfowl,</l>
        <l>In the air the grouse flew upward,</l>
        <l>And the flock ascended rushing</l>
        <l>From before the speeding courser.</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the ice there lay some feathers</l>
        <l>Cast by grouse upon the roadway;</l>
        <l>These collected Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And he put them in his pocket,</l>
        <l>For he knew not what might happen,</l>
        <l>Or might chance upon his journey.</l>
        <l>In a house are all things useful,</l>
        <l>Can at need be turned to something.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he drove a little further,</l>
        <l>On his road a little further,</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
        <l>When to neigh began the courser,</l>
        <l>Pricked his long ears up in terror.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>In the sledge at once leaned forward,</l>
        <l>Bending down to gaze about him.</l>
        <l>There he saw, as said his mother,</l>
        <l>As his own old mother warned him,</l>
        <l>How there flowed a fiery river,</l>
        <l>Right across the horse's pathway,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
        <l>In the stream a cataract fiery,</l>
        <l>In the fall a fiery island,</l>
        <l>On the isle a peak all fiery,</l>
        <l>On the peak a fiery eagle.</l>
        <l>In his throat the fire was seething,</l>
        <l>And his mouth with flame was glowing,</l>
        <l>And his plumage fire was flashing,</l>
        <l>And the sparks around were scattering.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kauko from afar he noticed,</l>
        <l>From afar saw Lemminkainen.</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Whither wilt thou go, O Kauko,</l>
        <l>Whither goes the son of Lempi?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Unto Pohja's feast I journey,</l>
        <l>The carousal held in secret.</l>
        <l>Turn thee on one side a little,</l>
        <l>From the youth's path do thou turn thee,</l>
        <l>Let the traveller make his journey,</l>
        <l>Do not hinder Lemminkainen,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
        <l>Therefore move aside a little,</l>
        <l>Let him now pursue his journey.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon the eagle answered,</l>
        <l>Hissing from his throat of fire,</l>
        <l>"I will let the traveller pass me,</l>
        <l>Will not hinder Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Through my mouth will let him hasten,</l>
        <l>Let him thus pursue his journey.</l>
        <l>Thither shall thy path direct thee,</l>
        <l>Fortunate shall be thy journey,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
        <l>To the banquet thou art seeking,</l>
        <l>Where thou all thy life may'st rest thee.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And he let it not concern him,</l>
        <l>But he felt into his pocket,</l>
        <l>And his pouch he opened quickly,</l>
        <l>Took the feathers of the blackfowl,</l>
        <l>Leisurely he rubbed the feathers,</l>
        <l>And between his palms he rubbed them,</l>
        <l>'Twixt his fingers ten in number,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
        <l>And a flock of grouse created,</l>
        <l>And a flock of capercailzies,</l>
        <l>In the eagle's beak he thrust them,</l>
        <l>To his greedy throat he gave them,</l>
        <l>To the eagle's throat all fiery,</l>
        <l>In the fire-bird's beak he thrust them,</l>
        <l>Thus he freed himself from danger,</l>
        <l>And escaped the first day's danger.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>With his whip he struck the courser,</l>
        <l>With the beaded whip he struck him,</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
        <l>And the horse sped quickly onward,</l>
        <l>And the steed sprang lightly forward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he drove a little further,</l>
        <l>But a little way had travelled,</l>
        <l>When the horse again was shying,</l>
        <l>And again the steed was neighing.</l>
        <l>From the sledge again he raised him,</l>
        <l>And he strove to gaze around him,</l>
        <l>And he saw, as said his mother,</l>
        <l>As his aged mother warned him,</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
        <l>Right in front a trench of fire,</l>
        <l>Right across the path extending,</l>
        <l>Ever to the east extending,</l>
        <l>North-west endlessly extending,</l>
        <l>Full of stones to redness heated,</l>
        <l>Full of blocks of stone all glowing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>But he raised a prayer to Ukko.</l>
        <l>"Ukko, thou, of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>Ukko, thou, our Heavenly Father,</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
        <l>Send thou now a cloud from north-west,</l>
        <l>Send thou from the west a second,</l>
        <l>And a third to east establish.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"In the north-east let them gather,</l>
        <l>Push their borders all together,</l>
        <l>Drive them edge to edge together,</l>
        <l>Let the snow fall staff-deep round me,</l>
        <l>Deep as is the length of spear-shaft,</l>
        <l>On these stones to redness heated,</l>
        <l>Blocks of stone all fiery glowing."</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Ukko, then, of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>He the aged Heavenly Father,</l>
        <l>Sent a cloud from out the north-west,</l>
        <l>From the west he sent a second,</l>
        <l>In the east a cloud let gather,</l>
        <l>Let them gather in the north-east;</l>
        <l>And he heaped them all together,</l>
        <l>And he closed the gaps between them,</l>
        <l>Let the snow fall staff-deep downward,</l>
        <l>Deep as is the length of spear-shaft,</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
        <l>On the stones to redness heated,</l>
        <l>Blocks of stone all fiery glowing.</l>
        <l>From the snow a pond was fashioned,</l>
        <l>And a lake with icy waters.</l>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Sang a bridge of ice together,</l>
        <l>Stretching right across the snow-pond,</l>
        <l>From the one bank to the other,</l>
        <l>O'er the fiery trench passed safely,</l>
        <l>Passed the second day in safety.</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>With his whip he urged the courser,</l>
        <l>Cracked the whip all bead-embroidered,</l>
        <l>And began to travel quickly,</l>
        <l>As the courser trotted onward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Quick he ran a verst, a second,</l>
        <l>For a short space well proceeded,</l>
        <l>When he suddenly stopped standing,</l>
        <l>Would not stir from his position.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Started up to gaze around him.</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
        <l>In the gate the wolf was standing,</l>
        <l>And the bear before the passage,</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's dread gateway,</l>
        <l>At the end of a long passage.</l>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Quickly felt into his pocket,</l>
        <l>What his pouch contained exploring,</l>
        <l>And he took some ewe's wool from it,</l>
        <l>And until 'twas soft he rubbed it,</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
        <l>And between his palms he rubbed it,</l>
        <l>'Twixt his fingers ten in number.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On his palms then gently breathing,</l>
        <l>Ewes ran bleating forth between them,</l>
        <l>Quite a flock of sheep he fashioned,</l>
        <l>And a flock of lambs among them,</l>
        <l>And the wolf rushed straight upon them,</l>
        <l>And the bear rushed after likewise,</l>
        <l>While the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Further drove upon his journey.</l><ref type="line number">580</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Yet a little space he journeyed,</l>
        <l>Unto Pohjola's enclosure.</l>
        <l>There a fence was raised of iron,</l>
        <l>Fenced with steel the whole enclosure,</l>
        <l>In the ground a hundred fathoms,</l>
        <l>In the sky a thousand fathoms,</l>
        <l>Spears they were which formed the hedgestakes,</l>
        <l>And for wattles creeping serpents,</l>
        <l>Thus the fence with snakes was wattled</l>
        <l>And among them there were lizards,</l><ref type="line number">590</ref>
        <l>And their tails were always waving,</l>
        <l>And their thick heads always swelling,</l>
        <l>Rows of heads erected always,</l>
        <l>Heads turned out and tails turned inwards.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Gave himself to his reflections.</l>
        <l>"This is what my mother told me,</l>
        <l>This is what my mother dreaded;</l>
        <l>Here I find a fence tremendous</l>
        <l>Reared aloft from earth to heaven,</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
        <l>Down below there creeps a viper,</l>
        <l>Deeper yet the fence is sunken,</l>
        <l>Up aloft a bird is flying,</l>
        <l>But the fence is builded higher.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Natheless was not Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Greatly troubled or uneasy;</l>
        <l>From the sheath he drew his knife out,</l>
        <l>From the sheath an iron weapon,</l>
        <l>And he hewed the fence to pieces,</l>
        <l>And in twain he clove the hedgestakes;</l><ref type="line number">610</ref>
        <l>Thus he breached the fence of iron,</l>
        <l>And he drove away the serpents</l>
        <l>From the space between five hedgestakes,</l>
        <l>Likewise from the space 'twixt seven,</l>
        <l>And himself pursued his journey,</l>
        <l>On to Pohjola's dark portal.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the path a snake was twisting,</l>
        <l>Just in front across the doorway,</l>
        <l>Even longer than the roof-tree,</l>

        Lemminkainen comes to Pohjola and behaves with the greatest insolence (1-204). The Lord of Pohjola grows angry, and as he can do nothing against Lemminkainen by magic, he challenges him to a duel (205-282). In the course of the duel Lemminkainen strikes off the head of the Lord of Pohjola, and to avenge this, the Mistress of Pohjola raises an army against him (283-420).

        <l>And the spoons she then was wiping,</l>
        <l>And the ladles she was scouring,</l>
        <l>Then into the pot put dinner,</l>

        <l>"O thou beer, thou drink so nasty,</l>
        <l>In an evil hour concocted,</l>
        <l>Evil only lurks within thee!</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Notwithstanding I will drink it,</l>
        <l>On the ground will cast the refuse,</l>
        <l>With my nameless finger lift it,</l>
        <l>With my left thumb will I lift it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he felt into his pocket,</l>
        <l>And within his pouch was searching,</l>
        <l>Took an angle from his pocket,</l>
        <l>Iron hooks from out his satchel,</l>
        <l>Dropped it down into the pint-pot,</l>
        <l>In the ale began to angle,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>Hooked the snakes upon his fish-hooks,</l>
        <l>On his hooks the evil vipers,</l>
        <l>Up he drew of toads a hundred,</l>
        <l>And of dusky snakes a thousand.</l>
        <l>Down upon the ground he threw them,</l>
        <l>Threw them all upon the planking,</l>
        <l>Thereupon a sharp knife taking,</l>
        <l>From the sheath he quickly drew it,</l>
        <l>Cut the heads from off the serpents,</l>
        <l>Broke the necks of all the serpents.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>Then he drank the ale with gusto,</l>
        <l>Drank the black mead with enjoyment,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"As a guest I am not honoured,</l>
        <l>Since no ale was brought unto me</l>
        <l>Which was better worth my drinking,</l>
        <l>Offered me by hands more careful,</l>
        <l>In a larger vessel brought me;</l>
        <l>Since no sheep was slaughtered for me,</l>
        <l>No gigantic steer was slaughtered,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>In the hall no ox they brought me,</l>
        <l>From the house of hooféd cattle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>Answer in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Wherefore have you then come hither,</l>
        <l>Who invited you among us?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
        <l>"Good is perhaps the guest invited,</l>
        <l>Better still if uninvited.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>Hearken then, thou son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Pohjola's illustrious Master,</l>
        <l>Give me ale for cash directly,</l>
        <l>Reach me here some drink for money.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>Angry grow and greatly furious,</l>
        <l>Very furious and indignant,</l>
        <l>Sang a pond upon the flooring,</l>
        <l>In the front of Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>"Here's a river you may drink of,</l>
        <l>Here's a pond that you may splash in.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"I'm no calf by women driven,</l>
        <l>Nor a bull with tail behind me,</l>
        <l>That I drink of river-water,</l>
        <l>Or from filthy ponds the water.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then himself began to conjure,</l>
        <l>And, himself commenced his singing,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Sang upon the floor a bullock,</l>
        <l>Mighty ox with horns all golden,</l>
        <l>And he soon drank up the puddle,</l>
        <l>Drank the river up with pleasure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the mighty son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>By his spells a wolf created,</l>
        <l>And upon the floor he sang him,</l>
        <l>To devour the fleshy bullock.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
        <l>Sang a white hare to his presence,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>And upon the floor 'twas leaping,</l>
        <l>Near the wolf-jaws widely opened.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the mighty son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Sang a dog with pointed muzzle;</l>
        <l>And the dog the hare devoured,</l>
        <l>Rent the Squint-eye into fragments.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
        <l>On the rafters sang a squirrel,</l>
        <l>And it frolicked on the rafters,</l>
        <l>And the dog was barking at it.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the mighty son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Sang a golden-breasted marten,</l>
        <l>And the marten seized the squirrel,</l>
        <l>On the rafter's end while sitting.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
        <l>Sang a fox of ruddy colour,</l>
        <l>And it killed the gold-breast marten,</l>
        <l>And destroyed the handsome-haired one.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the mighty son of Pohja</l>
        <l>By his spells a hen created,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>And upon the ground 'twas walking,</l>
        <l>Just before the fox's muzzle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
        <l>Thereupon a hawk created,</l>
        <l>Quickly with its claws it seized it,</l>
        <l>And it tore the hen to pieces.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>In the very words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Better will not be the banquet,</l>
        <l>Nor the guest-provision lessened.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>House for work, the road for strangers,</l>
        <l>Unrefreshed from the carousal!</l>
        <l>Quit this place, O scamp of Hiisi,</l>
        <l>Haste away from all folks' knowledge,</l>
        <l>To thy home, O toad the basest,</l>
        <l>Forth, O scoundrel, to thy country!.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"None would let himself be banished,</l>
        <l>Not a man, how bad soever,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>From this place be ever driven,</l>
        <l>Forced to fly from such a station.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>Snatch his sword from wall where hanging,</l>
        <l>Grasped in haste the sharpened weapon,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>Or thou handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Let us match our swords together,</l>
        <l>Match the glitter of the sword-blades,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>Whether my sword is the better,</l>
        <l>Or is Ahti Saarelainen's.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"Little of my sword is left me,</l>
        <l>For on bones it has been shattered,</l>
        <l>And on skulls completely broken!</l>
        <l>But let this be as it may be,</l>
        <l>If no better feast is ready,</l>
        <l>Let us struggle, and determine</l>
        <l>Which of our two swords is favoured.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>Ne'er in former times my father</l>
        <l>In a duel has been worsted,</l>
        <l>Why should then his son be different,</l>
        <l>Or his child be like a baby?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Sword he took, and bared his sword-blade,</l>
        <l>And he drew his sharp-edged weapon,</l>
        <l>Drew it from the leather scabbard,</l>
        <l>Hanging at his belt of lambskin.</l>
        <l>Then they measured and inspected</l>
        <l>Which of their two swords was longer,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>And a very little longer,</l>
        <l>Was the sword of Pohja's Master,</l>
        <l>As upon the nail the blackness,</l>
        <l>Or a half-joint of a finger.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Spoke then Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"As your sword is rather longer,</l>
        <l>Let the first attack be yours.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>Aim a blow, and tried to strike him,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>Aimed his sword, but never struck it,</l>
        <l>On the head of Lemminkainen.</l>
        <l>Once indeed he struck the rafters,</l>
        <l>And the beams resounded loudly,</l>
        <l>And across the beam was shattered,</l>
        <l>And the arch in twain was broken.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then spoke Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
        <l>"Well, what mischief did the rafters,</l>
        <l>And what harm the beam effected,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>That you thus attack the rafters,</l>
        <l>And have made the arch to rattle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Hear me, son of Pohja's country,</l>
        <l>Pohjola's illustrious Master,</l>
        <l>Awkward 'tis in room to combat,</l>
        <l>Trouble would it give the women,</l>
        <l>If the clean room should be damaged,</l>
        <l>And with blood defiled the flooring.</l>
        <l>Let us go into the courtyard,</l>
        <l>In the field outside to battle,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>On the grass outside to combat.</l>
        <l>In the yard the blood looks better,</l>
        <l>In the yard it looks more lovely,</l>
        <l>On the snow it looks much better.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Out into the yard they wandered,</l>
        <l>And they found therein a cowhide,</l>
        <l>And they spread it in the courtyard,</l>
        <l>And they took their stand upon it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>"Hearken, O thou son of Pohja!</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>As your sword is rather longer,</l>
        <l>And your sword is more terrific,</l>
        <l>Perhaps indeed you need to use it,</l>
        <l>Just before your own departure,</l>
        <l>Or before your neck is broken.</l>
        <l>Strike away, O son of Pohja.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Fenced away the son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Struck a blow, and struck a second,</l>
        <l>And he struck a third blow after,</l>
        <l>But he could not strike him fairly,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
        <l>Could not scratch the flesh upon him,</l>
        <l>From his skin a single bristle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then spoke Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Give me leave to try a little,</l>
        <l>For at last my time is coming.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Natheless Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>Did not pay the least attention,</l>
        <l>Striking on, without reflection,</l>
        <l>Ever striking, never hitting.</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
        <l>From his sword-blade flashed red fire,</l>
        <l>And its edge was always gleaming</l>
        <l>In the hands of Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And the sheen extended further,</l>
        <l>As against the neck he turned it,</l>
        <l>Of the mighty son of Pohja.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the handsome Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"Hearken, Pohjola's great Master,</l>
        <l>True it is, thy neck so wretched,</l>
        <l>Is as red as dawn of morning."</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        </lg>

        <l>Thereupon the son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>He, the mighty lord of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Bent his eyes that he might witness</l>
        <l>How his own neck had been reddened.</l>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Hurriedly a stroke delivered,</l>
        <l>With his sword he struck the hero,</l>
        <l>Quickly with the sword he struck him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Full and fair he struck the hero,</l>
        <l>Struck his head from off his shoulders,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>And the skull from neck he severed,</l>
        <l>As from off the stalk a turnip,</l>
        <l>Or an ear of corn is severed,</l>
        <l>From a fish a fin divided.</l>
        <l>In the yard the head went rolling,</l>
        <l>And the skull in the enclosure,</l>
        <l>As when it is struck by arrow</l>
        <l>Falls the capercail from tree-top.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the ground stood stakes a hundred,</l>
        <l>In the yard there stood a thousand,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
        <l>On the stakes were heads a hundred,</l>
        <l>Only one stake still was headless.</l>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Took the head of the poor fellow;</l>
        <l>From the ground the skull he lifted,</l>
        <l>And upon the stake he set it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Once again the house re-enter,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        <l>"Wicked maid, now bring me water,</l>
        <l>That I wash my hands and cleanse them,</l>

        <l>Furious was the Crone of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Wild with wrath and indignation,</l>
        <l>And at once she sang up swordsmen,</l>
        <l>Heroes well equipped for battle.</l>
        <l>Up she sang a hundred swordsmen,</l>

        <l>From the house the youthful Ahti</l>
        <l>Lemminkainen quick departed,</l>

        Lemminkainen escapes with all speed from Pohjola, comes home and asks his mother where he can hide himself from the people of Pohjola, who will soon attack him in his home, a hundred to one (1-164). His mother reproaches him for his expedition to Pohjola, suggests various places of concealment, and at length advises him to go far across the lakes to a distant island, where his father once lived in peace during a year of great war (165-294).

        <lg>
        <l>Then did Ahti Saarelainen,</l>

        <l>Seeking for the horse he left there,</l>
        <l>But he nowhere saw him standing;</l>
        <l>In the field a stone was standing,</l>

        <l>Of the scattered clouds the ruler!</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
        <l>Let it now be gloomy weather,</l>
        <l>And a little cloudlet give me,</l>
        <l>So that under its protection</l>
        <l>I may hasten homeward quickly,</l>
        <l>Homeward to my dearest mother,</l>
        <l>Unto the revered old woman.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>As he flew upon his journey,</l>
        <l>As he chanced to look behind him,</l>
        <l>There he saw a hawk, a grey one,</l>
        <l>And its eyes were fiery-glowing,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>As it were the son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Like the former lord of Pohja.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the grey hawk called unto him,</l>
        <l>"Ahti, O my dearest brother,</l>
        <l>Think you on our former combat,</l>
        <l>Head to head in equal contest?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"O my hawk, my bird so charming,</l>
        <l>Turn thyself and hasten homeward,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>To the place from which you started,</l>
        <l>To the gloomy land of Pohja.</l>
        <l>Hard it is to catch the eagle,</l>
        <l>Clutch the strong-winged bird with talons.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he hurried quickly homeward,</l>
        <l>Homeward to his dearest mother,</l>
        <l>And his face was full of trouble,</l>
        <l>And his heart with care o'erladen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then his mother came to meet him,</l>
        <l>As along the path he hurried,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>As he past the fence was walking,</l>
        <l>And his mother first bespoke him.</l>
        <l>"O my son, my son, my youngest,</l>
        <l>Thou the strongest of my children!</l>
        <l>Why returnest thou so sadly,</l>
        <l>Home from Pohjola's dark regions?</l>
        <l>Hast thou harmed thyself by drinking</l>
        <l>At the drinking-bout of Pohja?</l>
        <l>If the goblet made thee suffer,</l>
        <l>Here a better one awaits thee,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>Which thy father won in battle,</l>
        <l>Which he fought for in the contest.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>If the goblet made me suffer,</l>
        <l>I would overcome the masters,</l>
        <l>Overcome a hundred heroes,</l>
        <l>And would face a thousand heroes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"Wherefore art thou then in trouble?</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>If the horse has overcome you,</l>
        <l>Wherefore let the horse annoy you?</l>
        <l>If the horse has overcome you,</l>
        <l>You should buy yourself a better,</l>
        <l>With your father's lifelong savings,</l>
        <l>Which the aged man provided.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>If I quarrelled with the courser,</l>
        <l>Or the foal had over-reached me,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>I myself have shamed the masters,</l>
        <l>Overcome the horses' drivers,</l>
        <l>Foals and drivers I have vanquished,</l>
        <l>And the heroes with their coursers.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"Wherefore art thou then in trouble,</l>
        <l>Wherefore is thy heart so troubled,</l>
        <l>As from Pohjola thou comest?</l>
        <l>Have the women laughed about you,</l>
        <l>Or the maidens ridiculed you?</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>If the women laughed about you,</l>
        <l>Or the maidens ridiculed you,</l>
        <l>There are maidens to be jeered at,</l>
        <l>Other women to be laughed at.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>If the women laughed about me,</l>
        <l>Or the maidens ridiculed me,</l>
        <l>I would laugh at all their menfolk,</l>
        <l>And would wink at all the maidens,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>I would shame a hundred women,</l>
        <l>And a thousand brides would make them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"What has chanced, my son, my darling,</l>
        <l>Hast thou perhaps encountered something</l>
        <l>As to Pohjola thou wentest?</l>
        <l>Have you eaten perhaps too freely,</l>
        <l>Eaten much, too much have drunken,</l>
        <l>Or at night perchance when resting</l>
        <l>Have you seen a dream of evil?"</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Perhaps old women may remember,</l>
        <l>What in sleep they saw in vision!</l>
        <l>Though my nightly dreams I think on,</l>
        <l>Yet are those of daytime better.</l>
        <l>O my mother, aged woman,</l>
        <l>Fill my bag with fresh provisions,</l>
        <l>With a good supply of flour,</l>
        <l>And a lump of salt add likewise,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>For thy son must travel further,</l>
        <l>Journey to another country,</l>
        <l>Journey from this house beloved,</l>
        <l>Journey from this lovely dwelling,</l>
        <l>For the men their swords are whetting,</l>
        <l>And the lance-tips they are sharpening.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then his mother interrupted,</l>
        <l>Asking him his cause of trouble.</l>
        <l>"Wherefore whet the men their sword-blades,</l>
        <l>Wherefore sharpen they the lance-tips?"</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Therefore do they whet their sword-blades,</l>
        <l>Therefore they the lance-tips sharpen:</l>
        <l>On the head of me unhappy,</l>
        <l>On my neck to bring destruction.</l>
        <l>From a quarrel rose a duel,</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's enclosure;</l>
        <l>I have slain the son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Slain the very lord of Pohja,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Then rose Pohjola to battle,</l>
        <l>Close behind me comes the tumult,</l>
        <l>Raging all for my destruction,</l>
        <l>To surround a single warrior.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then his mother gave him answer,</l>
        <l>To her child the old crone answered:</l>
        <l>"I myself already told you,</l>
        <l>And I had already warned you,</l>
        <l>And forbidden you most strictly</l>
        <l>Not to Pohjola to venture.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>Had you stayed at home in quiet,</l>

        <l>Safely in your parent's homestead,</l>
        <l>In the home of her who bore thee,</l>
        <l>Then no war had ever risen,</l>
        <l>Nor appeared a cause of contest.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Whither now, my son unhappy,</l>
        <l>Canst thou flee, unhappy creature,</l>
        <l>Go to hide thee from destruction,</l>
        <l>Flying from thy wicked action,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>Lest thy wretched head be captured,</l>
        <l>And thy handsome neck be severed,</l>
        <l>That thy hair remain uninjured,</l>
        <l>Nor thy glossy hair downtrodden?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"No such refuge do I know of,</l>
        <l>Where a safe retreat awaits me,</l>
        <l>Where I from my crime can hide me.</l>
        <l>O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>Where do you advise my hiding?"</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"No, I know not where to hide you,</l>
        <l>Where to hide you or to send you.</l>
        <l>As a pine upon the mountain,</l>
        <l>Juniper in distant places,</l>
        <l>There might still misfortune find thee,</l>
        <l>Evil fate might rise against thee.</l>
        <l>Often is the mountain pine-tree</l>
        <l>Cut to pieces into torches,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>And the juniper on heathland,</l>
        <l>Into posts is often cloven.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>"As a birch-tree in the valley,</l>

        <l>Evil fate might rise against thee.</l>
        <l>Often is the valley birch-tree</l>
        <l>Chopped to pieces into faggots,</l>
        <l>Often is the alder-thicket</l>
        <l>Cut away to make a clearing.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        </lg>

        <l>There might still misfortune find thee,</l>
        <l>Evil fate might rise against thee,</l>
        <l>For the girls might come to pluck thee,</l>
        <l>Tin-adorned ones might uproot thee.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"In the lake as pike when hiding,</l>

        <l>There misfortune still might find thee,</l>

        <l>If there came a youthful fisher,</l>
        <l>He might cast his net in water,</l>

        <l>And the old with net might capture.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Didst thou roam as wolf in forest,</l>

        <l>If a sooty tramp was passing,</l>

        <l>And the forest bears might slaughter.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"I myself know evil places,</l>
        <l>Worst of all do I esteem them,</l>
        <l>There where any death might seize me,</l>
        <l>And at last destruction reach me.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>O my mother who hast reared me,</l>
        <l>Mother who thy milk hast given,</l>
        <l>Whither would'st thou bid me hide me,</l>
        <l>Whither should I now conceal me?</l>
        <l>Death's wide jaws are just before me,</l>
        <l>At my beard destruction's standing,</l>
        <l>Every day for me it waiteth,</l>
        <l>Till my ruin is accomplished.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>"I can tell the best of places,</l>
        <l>Tell you one the best of any,</l>
        <l>Where to hide yourself completely,</l>
        <l>And your crime conceal for ever,</l>
        <l>For I know a little country,</l>
        <l>Know a very little refuge,</l>
        <l>Wasted not, and safe from battle,</l>
        <l>And untrodden by the swordsmen.</l>
        <l>Swear me now by oaths eternal,</l>
        <l>Binding, free from all deception,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>In the course of sixty summers,</l>
        <l>Nevermore to go to battle,</l>

        <l>Nor perchance if gold was needed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"Now I swear by oaths the strongest,</l>
        <l>Never in the first of summers,</l>
        <l>Nor in any other summer,</l>
        <l>Mix myself in mighty battles,</l>

        <l>In the midst of mighty battles,</l>
        <l>Where the heroes all contended.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
        <l>Answer in the words which follow:</l>

        <l>Hid, and kept himself in safety,</l>
        <l>In the furious fights of summer,</l>

        <l>There you'll find a pleasant dwelling,</l>

        <l>Hide thyself a year, a second,</l>

        <head>LEMMINKAINEN'S ADVENTURES ON THE ISLAND</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Lemminkainen sails across the lakes in his boat and comes safely to the island (1-180). There he lives pleasantly among the girls and women till the return of the men from warfare, who conspire against him (181-290). Lemminkainen flies from the island, much to the grief both of the girls and himself (291-402). His boat is wrecked in a violent storm, but he escapes by swimming to land, makes a new boat, and arrives safely on the shores of his own country (403-452). He finds his old house burned, and the whole surroundings laid waste, when he begins to weep and lament, especially for the loss of his mother (453-514). His mother, however, is still alive, having taken refuge in a thick forest where Lemminkainen finds her to his great joy (515-546). She relates how the army of Pohjola came and burned down the house. Lemminkainen promises to build a finer house after he has revenged himself upon the people of Pohjola, and describes his pleasant life in the island of refuge (547-602).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Took provisions in his satchel,</l>
        <l>In his wallet summer-butter,</l>
        <l>Butter for a year to last him,</l>
        <l>For another, pork sufficient,</l>
        <l>Then he travelled off to hide him,</l>
        <l>Started in the greatest hurry,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Now I go, and I'm escaping,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>For the space of three whole summers,</l>
        <l>And for five years in succession.</l>
        <l>Be the land to snakes abandoned,</l>
        <l>Let the lynxes snarl in greenwood,</l>
        <l>In the fields the reindeer wander,</l>
        <l>In the brakes the geese conceal them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Fare thee well, my dearest mother,</l>
        <l>If the people come from Pohja,</l>
        <l>From Pimentola the army,</l>
        <l>And about my head they ask you,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>Say that I have fled before them,</l>
        <l>And have taken my departure,</l>
        <l>And I have laid waste my clearing,</l>
        <l>That which I had reaped so lately.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he pushed his boat in water,</l>
        <l>On the waves he launched his vessel,</l>
        <l>From the rollers steel he launched it,</l>
        <l>From the haven lined with copper.</l>
        <l>On the mast the sails he hoisted,</l>
        <l>And he spread the sails of linen,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        <l>At the stern himself he seated,</l>
        <l>And prepared him for his journey,</l>
        <l>Sitting by his birchwood rudder,</l>
        <l>With the stern-oar deftly steering.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Wind, inflate the sails above me,</l>
        <l>Wind of spring drive on the vessel,</l>
        <l>Drive with speed the wooden vessel,</l>

        <l>So the wind the bark drove onward,</l>
        <l>O'er the foaming lake 'twas driven,</l>
        <l>O'er the bright expanse of water,</l>
        <l>Speeding o'er the open water,</l>
        <l>Rocking while two moons were changing,</l>
        <l>Till a third was near its ending.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>At the cape were maidens sitting,</l>
        <l>There upon the blue lake's margin</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>They were gazing, and were casting</l>
        <l>Glances o'er the azure billows.</l>
        <l>One was waiting for her brother,</l>
        <l>And another for her father,</l>
        <l>But the others all were waiting,</l>
        <l>Waiting each one for a lover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the distance spied they Kauko,</l>
        <l>Sooner still the boat of Kauko,</l>
        <l>Like a little cloud in distance,</l>
        <l>Just between the sky and water.</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the island-maids reflected,</l>
        <l>Said the maidens of the island:</l>
        <l>"What's this strange thing in the water,</l>
        <l>What this wonder on the billows?</l>
        <l>If a boat of our relations,</l>
        <l>Sailing vessel of our island,</l>
        <l>Hasten then, and speed thee homeward,</l>
        <l>To the harbour of the island,</l>
        <l>That we hear the tidings quickly,</l>
        <l>Hear the news from foreign countries,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>If there's peace among the shore-folks,</l>
        <l>Or if war is waged among them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Still the wind the sail inflated,</l>
        <l>And the billows drove the vessel.</l>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Guided to the isle the vessel,</l>
        <l>To the island's end he drove it,</l>
        <l>Where it ends in jutting headland.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And he said on his arrival,</l>
        <l>To the cape as he was coming,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>"Is there room upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l>
        <l>Where the boat may land upon it,</l>
        <l>And to dry land I may bring it?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the girls upon the island,</l>
        <l>And the island-maidens answered:</l>
        <l>"There is room upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l>
        <l>Where the boat may land upon it,</l>
        <l>And to dry land you may bring it.</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>There are harbours for the vessel,</l>
        <l>On the beach sufficient rollers,</l>
        <l>To receive a hundred vessels,</l>
        <l>Though the boats should come by thousands.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>On the land drew up his vessel,</l>
        <l>On the wooden rollers laid it,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Is there room upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>Where a little man may hide him,</l>

        <l>And the clash of steely sword-blades?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the girls upon the island,</l>
        <l>And the island-maidens answered:</l>
        <l>"There is room upon this island,</l>

        <l>Here are very many castles,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Is there room upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l>
        <l>Where there stands a birch-tree forest,</l>

        <l>Where I perhaps may make a clearing,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the girls upon the island,</l>
        <l>And the island-maidens answered:</l>
        <l>"There is not upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l>
        <l>Not the space your back could rest on,</l>
        <l>Land not of a bushel's measure,</l>

        <l>Work upon your goodly clearing.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>All the land is now divided,</l>
        <l>And the fields in plots are measured,</l>
        <l>And allotted are the fallows,</l>
        <l>Grassland managed by the commune.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Asked the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"Is there room upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l>
        <l>Space where I my songs may carol,</l>
        <l>Space where I may sing my ballads?</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>Words within my mouth are melting,</l>
        <l>And between my gums are sprouting.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the girls upon the island,</l>
        <l>And the island-maidens answered:</l>
        <l>"There is room upon this island,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the island,</l>
        <l>Space where you may sing your ballads,</l>
        <l>And intone your splendid verses,</l>
        <l>While you sport amid the greenwood,</l>
        <l>While you dance among the meadows."</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Hastened to commence his singing.</l>
        <l>In the court sang mountain-ashtrees,</l>
        <l>In the farmyard oaks grew upward.</l>
        <l>On the oaks were equal branches,</l>
        <l>And on every branch an acorn,</l>
        <l>Golden globes within the acorns,</l>
        <l>And upon the globes were cuckoos.</l>
        <l>When the cuckoos all were calling,</l>
        <l>From their mouths was gold distilling,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>From their beaks was copper flowing,</l>
        <l>Likewise silver pouring onward</l>
        <l>To the hills all golden-shining,</l>
        <l>And among the silver mountains.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Once again sang Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Once again he sang and chanted,</l>
        <l>Gravel sang to pearls of beauty,</l>
        <l>All the stones to gleaming lustre,</l>
        <l>All the stones to glowing redness,</l>
        <l>And the flowers to golden glory.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then again sang Lemminkainen;</l>
        <l>In the yard a well created,</l>
        <l>O'er the well a golden cover,</l>
        <l>And on this a golden bucket,</l>
        <l>That the lads might drink the water,</l>
        <l>And their sisters wash their faces.</l>
        <l>Ponds he sang upon the meadows,</l>
        <l>In the ponds blue ducks were floating,</l>
        <l>Temples golden, heads of silver,</l>
        <l>And their claws were all of copper.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the island-maidens wondered,</l>
        <l>And the girls were all astounded</l>
        <l>At the songs of Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And the craft of that great hero.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Spoke the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"I have sung a song most splendid,</l>
        <l>But perchance might sing a better,</l>
        <l>If beneath a roof I sang it,</l>
        <l>At the end of the deal table.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>If a house you cannot give me,</l>
        <l>There to rest upon the planking,</l>
        <l>I will hum my tunes in forest,</l>
        <l>Toss my songs among the bushes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the maidens of the island,</l>
        <l>Answered after full reflection:</l>
        <l>"There are houses you may enter,</l>
        <l>Handsome halls that you may dwell in,</l>
        <l>Safe from cold to sing your verses,</l>
        <l>In the open speak your magic."</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Entered in a house directly,</l>
        <l>Where he sang a row of pint-pots,</l>
        <l>At the end of the long table.</l>
        <l>All the pots with ale were brimming,</l>
        <l>And the cans with mead the finest,</l>
        <l>Filled as full as one could fill them,</l>
        <l>Dishes filled to overflowing.</l>
        <l>In the pots was beer in plenty,</l>
        <l>And the mead in covered tankards,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>Butter too, in great abundance,</l>
        <l>Pork was likewise there in plenty,</l>
        <l>For the feast of Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>And for Kaukomieli's pleasure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kauko was of finest manners,</l>
        <l>Nor to eat was he accustomed,</l>
        <l>Only with a knife of silver,</l>
        <l>Fitted with a golden handle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So he sang a knife of silver,</l>
        <l>And a golden-hafted knife-blade,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>And he ate till he was sated,</l>
        <l>Drank the ale in full contentment.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Roamed about through every village,</l>
        <l>For the island-maidens' pleasure,</l>
        <l>To delight the braidless damsels,</l>
        <l>And where'er his head was turning,</l>
        <l>There he found a mouth for kissing,</l>
        <l>Wheresoe'er his hand was outstretched,</l>
        <l>There he found a hand to clasp it.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And at night he went to rest him,</l>
        <l>Hiding in the darkest corner;</l>
        <l>There was not a single village</l>
        <l>Where he did not find ten homesteads,</l>
        <l>There was not a single homestead</l>
        <l>Where he did not find ten daughters,</l>
        <l>There was none among the daughters,</l>
        <l>None among the mother's children,</l>
        <l>By whose side he did not stretch him,</l>
        <l>On whose arm he did not rest him.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus a thousand brides he found there,</l>
        <l>Rested by a hundred widows;</l>
        <l>Two in half-a-score remained not,</l>
        <l>Three in a completed hundred,</l>
        <l>Whom he left untouched as maidens,</l>
        <l>Or as widows unmolested.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Lived a life of great enjoyment,</l>
        <l>For the course of three whole summers</l>
        <l>In the island's pleasant hamlets,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>To the island-maidens' rapture,</l>
        <l>The content of all the widows;</l>
        <l>One alone he did not trouble,</l>
        <l>'Twas a poor and aged maiden,</l>
        <l>At the furthest promontory,</l>
        <l>In the tenth among the hamlets.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>As he pondered on his journey,</l>
        <l>And resolved to wend him homeward,</l>
        <l>Came the poor and aged maiden,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>"Handsome hero, wretched Kauko,</l>
        <l>If you will not think upon me,</l>
        <l>Then I wish that as you travel,</l>
        <l>May your boat on rocks be stranded.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Rose he not before the cockcrow,</l>
        <l>Nor before the hen's child rose he,</l>
        <l>From his sporting with the maiden,</l>
        <l>Laughing with the wretched woman.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then upon a day it happened,</l>
        <l>And upon a certain evening,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>He resolved to rise and wander,</l>
        <l>Waiting not for morn or cockcrow.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Long before the time he rose up,</l>
        <l>Sooner than the time intended,</l>
        <l>And he went around to wander,</l>
        <l>And to wander through the village,</l>
        <l>For his sporting with the damsels,</l>
        <l>To amuse the wretched women.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>As alone by night he wandered,</l>
        <l>Through the villages he sauntered</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>To the isle's extremest headland,</l>
        <l>To the tenth among the hamlets,</l>
        <l>He beheld not any homestead</l>
        <l>Where three rooms he did not notice,</l>
        <l>There was not a room among them</l>
        <l>Where he did not see three heroes,</l>
        <l>And he saw not any hero,</l>
        <l>With a sword-blade left unwhetted,</l>
        <l>Sharpened thus to bring destruction</l>

        </lg>

        <l>"Woe to me, the day is dawning,</l>
        <l>And the pleasant sun is rising</l>
        <l>O'er a youth, of all most wretched,</l>
        <l>O'er the neck of me unhappy!</l>
        <l>Lempo may perchance a hero</l>
        <l>With his shirt protect and cover,</l>
        <l>Perhaps will cover with his mantle,</l>
        <l>Cast it round him for protection</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>Though a hundred men attacked him,</l>
        <l>And a thousand pressed upon him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Unembraced he left the maidens,</l>
        <l>And he left them unmolested,</l>
        <l>And he turned him to his vessel,</l>
        <l>Luckless to his boat he hurried,</l>
        <l>But he found it burned to ashes,</l>
        <l>Utterly consumed to ashes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Mischief now he saw approaching,</l>
        <l>O'er his head ill days were brooding,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>So began to build a vessel,</l>
        <l>And a new boat to construct him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Wood was failing to the craftsman,</l>
        <l>Boards with which a boat to fashion,</l>
        <l>But he found of wood a little,</l>
        <l>Begged some wretched bits of boarding,</l>
        <l>Five small splinters of a spindle,</l>
        <l>And six fragments of a bobbin.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So from these a boat he fashioned,</l>
        <l>And a new boat he constructed,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>By his magic art he made it,</l>
        <l>With his secret knowledge made it,</l>
        <l>Hammered once, one side he fashioned,</l>
        <l>Hammered twice, called up the other,</l>
        <l>Hammered then a third time only,</l>
        <l>And the boat was quite completed.</l>
        <l>Then he pushed the boat in water,</l>
        <l>On the waves he launched the vessel,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And expressed himself in thiswise:</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>"Float like bladder on the water,</l>
        <l>On the waves like water-lily.</l>
        <l>Eagle, give me now three feathers,</l>
        <l>Eagle, three, and two from raven,</l>

        <l>For the wretched vessel's bulwarks.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he stepped upon the planking,</l>
        <l>At the stern he took his station,</l>
        <l>Head bowed down, in deep depression,</l>
        <l>And his cap awry adjusted,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>Since by night he dare not tarry,</l>

        <l>Thus departeth Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Quits you thus your hero-bridegroom,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>Since the great desire has seized me,</l>
        <l>Longing for my native country,</l>
        <l>Longing for my own land's strawberries,</l>
        <l>For the slopes where grow the raspberries,</l>
        <l>For the maidens on the headland,</l>
        <l>And the poultry of my farmyard.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Pushed into the waves the vessel,</l>
        <l>Blew the wind, and then it blustered,</l>
        <l>Rising waves drove on the vessel</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>O'er the blue lake's shining surface,</l>
        <l>And across the open water.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the beach there stood the sad ones,</l>
        <l>On the shingles the unhappy,</l>
        <l>And the island girls were weeping,</l>
        <l>And the golden maids lamenting.</l>
        <l>Wept for long the island-maidens,</l>
        <l>Damsels on the cape lamented,</l>
        <l>Long as they could see the masthead,</l>
        <l>And the ironwork was gleaming,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
        <l>But they wept not for the masthead,</l>
        <l>Nor bewailed the iron fittings,</l>
        <l>By the mast they wept the steersman,</l>
        <l>He who wrought the iron fittings.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen too was weeping,</l>
        <l>Long he wept, and long was saddened,</l>
        <l>Long as he could see the island,</l>
        <l>Or the outline of its mountains;</l>
        <l>But he wept not for the island,</l>
        <l>Nor lamented for the mountains,</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        <l>But he wept the island-damsels,</l>
        <l>For the mountain geese lamented.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>O'er the blue lake took his journey,</l>
        <l>And he voyaged one day, a second,</l>
        <l>And at length upon the third day</l>
        <l>Rose a furious wind against him,</l>
        <l>And the whole horizon thundered.</l>
        <l>Rose a great wind from the north-west,</l>
        <l>And a strong wind from the north-east,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
        <l>Struck one side and then the other,</l>
        <l>Thus the vessel overturning.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Plunged his hands into the water,</l>
        <l>Rowing forward with his fingers,</l>
        <l>While his feet he used for steering.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus he swam by night and daytime</l>
        <l>And with greatest skill he steered him,</l>
        <l>And a little cloud perceived he,</l>
        <l>In the west a cloud projecting,</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
        <l>Which to solid land was changing,</l>
        <l>And became a promontory.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the cape he found a homestead,</l>
        <l>Where he found the mistress baking,</l>
        <l>And her daughters dough were kneading.</l>
        <l>"O thou very gracious mistress,</l>
        <l>If you but perceived my hunger,</l>
        <l>Thought upon my sad condition,</l>
        <l>You would hurry to the storehouse,</l>
        <l>To the alehouse like a snowstorm,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
        <l>And a can of ale would fetch me,</l>
        <l>And a strip of pork would fetch me,</l>
        <l>In the pan would broil it for me,</l>
        <l>And would pour some butter on it,</l>
        <l>That the weary man might eat it,</l>
        <l>And the fainting hero drink it.</l>
        <l>Nights and days have I been swimming</l>
        <l>Out upon the broad lake's billows,</l>
        <l>With the wind as my protector,</l>
        <l>At the mercy of the lake-waves."</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon the gracious mistress</l>
        <l>Hastened to the mountain storehouse,</l>
        <l>Sliced some butter in the storehouse,</l>
        <l>And a slice of pork provided,</l>
        <l>In the pan thereafter broiled it,</l>
        <l>That the hungry man might eat it.</l>
        <l>Then she fetched of ale a canful,</l>
        <l>For the fainting hero's drinking,</l>
        <l>And she gave him a new vessel,</l>
        <l>And a boat completely finished,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
        <l>Which to other lands should take him,</l>
        <l>And convey him to his birthplace.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Started on his homeward journey,</l>
        <l>Saw the lands and saw the beaches,</l>
        <l>Here the islands, there the channels,</l>
        <l>Saw the ancient landing-stages,</l>
        <l>Saw the former dwelling-places,</l>
        <l>And he saw the pine-clad mountains,</l>
        <l>All the hills with fir-trees covered,</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
        <l>But he found no more his homestead,</l>
        <l>And the walls he found not standing;</l>
        <l>Where the house before was standing,</l>
        <l>Rustled now a cherry-thicket,</l>
        <l>On the mound were pine-trees growing,</l>
        <l>Juniper beside the well-spring.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Spoke the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>"I have roamed among these forests,</l>
        <l>O'er the stones, and plunged in river,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
        <l>And have played about the meadows,</l>
        <l>And have wandered through the cornfields.</l>
        <l>Who has spoiled my well-known homestead,</l>
        <l>And destroyed my charming dwelling?</l>
        <l>They have burned the house to ashes,</l>
        <l>And the wind's dispersed the ashes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon he fell to weeping,</l>
        <l>And he wept one day, a second,</l>
        <l>But he wept not for the homestead,</l>
        <l>Nor lamented for the storehouse,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
        <l>But he wept the house's treasure,</l>
        <l>Dearer to him than the storehouse.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he saw a bird was flying,</l>
        <l>And a golden eagle hovering,</l>
        <l>And he then began to ask it:</l>
        <l>"O my dearest golden eagle,</l>
        <l>Can you not perchance inform me,</l>
        <l>What has happened to my mother,</l>
        <l>To the fair one who has borne me,</l>
        <l>To my dear and much-loved mother?"</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Nothing knew the eagle of her,</l>
        <l>Nor the stupid bird could tell him,</l>
        <l>Only knew that she had perished;</l>
        <l>Said a raven she had fallen,</l>
        <l>And had died beneath the sword-blades,</l>
        <l>'Neath the battle-axes fallen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
        <l>"O my fair one who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>O my dear and much-loved mother!</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
        <l>Hast thou perished, who hast borne me,</l>
        <l>Hast thou gone, O tender mother?</l>
        <l>Now thy flesh in earth has rotted,</l>
        <l>Fir-trees o'er thy head are growing,</l>
        <l>Juniper upon thy ankles,</l>
        <l>On thy finger-tips are willows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Thus my wretched doom has found me,</l>
        <l>And an ill reward has reached me,</l>
        <l>That my sword I dared to measure,</l>
        <l>And I dared to raise my weapons</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
        <l>There in Pohjola's great castle,</l>
        <l>In the fields of Pimentola.</l>
        <l>But my own race now has perished,</l>
        <l>Perished now is she who bore me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he looked, and turned on all sides,</l>
        <l>And he saw a trace of footsteps,</l>
        <l>Where the grass was lightly trampled,</l>
        <l>And the heath was slightly broken.</l>
        <l>Then he went the way they led him,</l>
        <l>And he found a little pathway;</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
        <l>To the forest led the pathway,</l>
        <l>And he went in that direction.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus he walked a verst, a second,</l>
        <l>Hurried through a stretch of country,</l>
        <l>And in darkest shades of forest,</l>
        <l>In the most concealed recesses,</l>
        <l>There he saw a hidden bath-house,</l>
        <l>Saw a little cottage hidden,</l>
        <l>In a cleft two rocks protected,</l>
        <l>In a nook between three fir-trees;</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
        <l>There he saw his tender mother,</l>
        <l>There beheld the aged woman.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Felt rejoiced beyond all measure,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"O my very dearest mother,</l>
        <l>O my mother who hast nursed me,</l>
        <l>Thou art living still, O mother,</l>
        <l>Watchful still, my aged mother!</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
        <l>Yet I thought that thou had'st perished,</l>
        <l>And wast lost to me for ever,</l>
        <l>Perished underneath the sword-blades,</l>
        <l>Or beneath the spears had'st fallen,</l>
        <l>And I wept my pretty eyes out,</l>
        <l>And my handsome cheeks were ruined.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
        <l>"True it is that I am living,</l>
        <l>But was forced to fly my dwelling,</l>
        <l>And to seek a place of hiding</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
        <l>In this dark and gloomy forest,</l>
        <l>In the most concealed recesses,</l>
        <l>When came Pohjola to battle,</l>
        <l>Murderous hosts from distant countries,</l>
        <l>Seeking but for thee, unhappy,</l>
        <l>And our home they laid in ruins,</l>
        <l>And they burned the house to ashes,</l>
        <l>And they wasted all the holding.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen:</l>
        <l>"O my mother who hast borne me,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
        <l>Do not give thyself to sadness,</l>
        <l>Be not sad, and be not troubled.</l>
        <l>We will now erect fresh buildings,</l>
        <l>Better buildings than the others,</l>
        <l>And will wage a war with Pohja,</l>
        <l>Overthrowing Lempo's people.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
        <l>Answer in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Long hast thou, my son, been absent,</l>
        <l>Long, my Kauko, hast been living</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
        <l>In a distant foreign country,</l>
        <l>Always in the doors of strangers,</l>
        <l>On a nameless promontory,</l>
        <l>And upon an unknown island.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
        <l>"There to dwell was very pleasant,</l>
        <l>Charming was it there to wander.</l>
        <l>There the trees are crimson-shining,</l>

        <l>And the pine-boughs shine like silver,</l>

        <l>Milk flows from the barren fir-trees,</l>
        <l>Butter flows from corner-fences,</l>
        <l>From the posts the ale is flowing.</l>

        <l>Afterwards 'twas bad to live there,</l>
        <l>And unfit for me to live there.</l>
        <l>They were anxious for the maidens,</l>
        <l>And suspicious of the women,</l>
        <l>Lest the miserable wenches,</l>
        <l>And the fat and wicked creatures,</l>
        <l>Might by me be badly treated,</l>
        <l>Visited too much at night-time.</l>
        <l>But I hid me from the maidens,</l>
        <l>And the women's daughters guarded</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
        <l>Just as hides the wolf from porkers,</l>

        <div type="argument">
        Lemminkainen goes to ask his former comrade-in-arms, Tiera, to join him in an expedition against Pohjola (1-122). The Mistress of Pohjola sends the Frost against them, who freezes the boat in the sea, and almost freezes the heroes themselves in the boat, but that Lemminkainen restrains it by powerful charms and invocations (123-316). Lemminkainen and his companion walk across the ice to the shore, wander about in the waste for a long time in a miserable plight, and at last make their way home (317-500).

        <lg>
        <l>Ahti, youth for ever youthful,</l>
        <l>Lemminkainen young and lively,</l>
        <l>Very early in the morning,</l>
        <l>In the very earliest morning,</l>
        <l>Sauntered downward to the boathouse,</l>
        <l>To the landing-stage he wandered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>There a wooden boat was weeping,</l>
        <l>Boat with iron rowlocks grieving;</l>
        <l>"Here am I, for sailing ready,</l>
        <l>But, O wretched one, rejected.</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>Ahti rows not forth to battle,</l>
        <l>For the space of sixty summers,</l>

        <l>Or if need of gold should drive him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Struck his glove upon the vessel,</l>
        <l>With his coloured glove he struck it,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Care thou not, O deck of pinewood,</l>
        <l>Nor lament, O timber-sided.</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he went to seek his mother,</l>

        <l>"Do not weep for me, O mother,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To restrain him sought his mother,</l>
        <l>And the aged woman warned him:</l>
        <l>"Do not go, my son, my dearest,</l>

        <l>Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>But he thought on his departure,</l>
        <l>And he started on his journey,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Can I find another hero,</l>
        <l>Find a man, and find a swordsman,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Through the villages he wandered,</l>

        <l>There was not a single village</l>

        <l>There was none among the houses,</l>

        <l>At the door the ruddy brothers,</l>
        <l>And they wrought a sledge's framework;</l>
        <l>At the bridge-end stood the sisters,</l>
        <l>And the clothes they there were wringing.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the window spoke the father,</l>
        <l>And the mother from the threshold,</l>
        <l>From the door the ruddy brothers,</l>
        <l>From the bridge-end spoke the sisters,</l>
        <l>"Tiera cannot go to battle,</l>
        <l>Nor may strike with spear in warfare.</l>
        <l>Other duties call for Tiera,</l>
        <l>He has made a lifelong compact,</l>
        <l>For a young wife has he taken</l>
        <l>As the mistress of his household,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>But untouched is she at present,</l>
        <l>Uncaressed is still her bosom.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>By the stove was Tiera resting,</l>
        <l>By the stove-side Kuura rested,</l>
        <l>At the stove one foot he booted,</l>
        <l>And the other at the stove-bench,</l>
        <l>At the gate his belt he tightened,</l>
        <l>In the open girt it round him;</l>
        <l>Then did Tiera grasp his spear-shaft,</l>
        <l>Not the largest of the largest,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>Nor the smallest of the smallest,</l>
        <l>But a spear of mid dimensions.</l>
        <l>On the blade a steed was standing,</l>
        <l>On the side a foal was trotting,</l>
        <l>At the joint a wolf was howling,</l>
        <l>At the haft a bear was growling.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus his spear did Tiera brandish,</l>
        <l>And he brandished it to whirring,</l>
        <l>Hurled it then to fathom-deepness</l>
        <l>In the stiff clay of the cornfield,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>In a bare spot of the meadow,</l>
        <l>In a flat spot free from hillocks.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then his spear was placed by Tiera</l>
        <l>With the other spears of Ahti,</l>
        <l>And he went and made him ready</l>
        <l>Swift to join in Ahti's battle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Ahti Saarelainen</l>
        <l>Push his boat into the water,</l>
        <l>Like a snake in grass when creeping,</l>
        <l>Even like a living serpent,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>And he sailed away to north-west,</l>
        <l>On the lake that borders Pohja.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
        <l>Call the wicked Frost to aid her,</l>
        <l>On the lake that borders Pohja,</l>
        <l>On the deep and open water,</l>
        <l>And she said the words which follow,</l>
        <l>Thus she spoke and thus commanded:</l>
        <l>"O my Frost, my boy so little,</l>
        <l>O thou foster-child I nurtured!</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>Go thou forth where I shall bid thee,</l>
        <l>Where I bid thee, and I send thee.</l>
        <l>Freeze the boat of that great scoundrel,</l>
        <l>Boat of lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>On the lake's extended surface,</l>
        <l>On the deep and open water,</l>
        <l>Freeze thou too the master in it,</l>
        <l>Freeze thou in the boat the rascal,</l>
        <l>That he nevermore escape thee,</l>
        <l>In the course of all his lifetime,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>If myself I do not loose him,</l>
        <l>If myself I do not free him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the Frost, that wicked fellow,</l>
        <l>And a youth the most malicious,</l>
        <l>Went upon the lake to freeze it,</l>
        <l>And upon the waves he brooded.</l>
        <l>Forth he went, as he was ordered,</l>
        <l>And upon the land he wandered,</l>
        <l>Bit the leaves from off the branches,</l>
        <l>Grass from off the flowerless meadows.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he came upon his journey</l>
        <l>To the lake that borders Pohja,</l>
        <l>To the endless waste of water,</l>
        <l>And upon the first night only</l>
        <l>Froze the bays and froze the lakelets,</l>
        <l>Hurried forward on the seashore,</l>
        <l>But the lake was still unfrozen,</l>
        <l>And the waves were still unstiffened.</l>
        <l>If a small finch swam the water,</l>
        <l>On the waves a water-wagtail,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Still its claws remained unfrozen,</l>
        <l>And its little head unstiffened.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the second night, however,</l>
        <l>He began to work more strongly,</l>
        <l>Growing insolent extremely,</l>
        <l>And he now grew most terrific,</l>
        <l>Then the ice on ice he loaded,</l>
        <l>And the great Frost still was freezing,</l>
        <l>And with ice he clothed the mountains,</l>
        <l>Scattered snow to height of spear-shaft,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>Froze the boat upon the water,</l>
        <l>Ahti's vessel on the billows;</l>
        <l>Then he would have frozen Ahti,</l>
        <l>And in ice his feet would fasten,</l>
        <l>And he seized upon his fingers,</l>
        <l>And beneath his toes attacked him.</l>
        <l>Angry then was Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Very angry and indignant,</l>
        <l>Pushed the Frost into the fire,</l>
        <l>Pushed him in an iron furnace.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>With his hands the Frost then seized he,</l>
        <l>Grasped him in his fists securely,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Pakkanen, Puhuri's offspring,</l>
        <l>Thou, the son of cold of winter,</l>
        <l>Do not make my fingers frozen,</l>
        <l>Nor my little toes thus stiffen.</l>
        <l>Let my ears remain unhandled,</l>
        <l>Do not freeze my head upon me.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"There's enough that may be frozen,</l>
        <l>Much is left you for your freezing,</l>
        <l>Though the skins of men you freeze not,</l>
        <l>Nor the forms of mother's children.</l>
        <l>Be the plains and marshes frozen,</l>
        <l>Freeze the stones to frozen coldness,</l>
        <l>Freeze the willows near the water,</l>
        <l>Grasp the aspen till it murmurs,</l>
        <l>Peel the bark from off the birch-tree,</l>
        <l>And the pine-trees break to pieces,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>But the men you shall not trouble,</l>
        <l>Nor the hair of mother's children.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"If this is not yet sufficient,</l>
        <l>Other things remain for freezing.</l>
        <l>Thou may'st freeze the stones when heated,</l>
        <l>And the slabs of stone when glowing,</l>
        <l>Thou may'st freeze the iron mountains,</l>
        <l>And the rocks of steely hardness,</l>
        <l>And the mighty river Vuoksi,</l>
        <l>Or the Imatra terrific,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>Stop the course of raging whirlpool,</l>

        <l>Surely do I know thy lineage,</l>
        <l>All I know of thine uprearing;</l>
        <l>For the Frost was born 'mid willows,</l>
        <l>Nurtured in the sharpest weather,</l>
        <l>Near to Pohjola's great homestead,</l>
        <l>Near the hall of Pimentola,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Sprung from father, ever crime-stained,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>"Who was it the Frost who suckled,</l>
        <l>Bathed him in the glowing weather?</l>
        <l>Milkless wholly was his mother,</l>
        <l>And his mother wholly breastless.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Adders 'twas the Frost who suckled,</l>
        <l>Adders suckled, serpents fed him,</l>
        <l>Suckled with their pointless nipples,</l>
        <l>Suckled with their dried-up udders,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>And the Northwind rocked his cradle,</l>
        <l>And to rest the cold air soothed him,</l>
        <l>In the wretched willow-thicket,</l>
        <l>In the midst of quaking marshes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"And the boy was reared up vicious,</l>
        <l>Led an evil life destructive,</l>
        <l>But as yet no name was given,</l>
        <l>To a boy so wholly worthless;</l>
        <l>When at length a name was given,</l>

        <l>To the midst of coals of Hiisi,</l>

        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>

        <head>UNTAMO AND KULLERVO</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Untamo wages war against his brother Kalervo, overthrows Kalervo and his army, sparing only a single pregnant woman of the whole clan. She is carried away to Untamo's people, and gives birth to her son Kullervo (1-82). Kullervo resolves in his cradle to take revenge on Untamo, and Untamo attempts several times to put him to death, but without success (83-202). When Kullervo grows up, he spoils all his work, and therefore Untamo sells him as a slave to Ilmarinen (203-374).

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Untamoinen laid his netting</l>
        <l>Down in Kalervo's fish-waters:</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>Kalervoinen saw the netting,</l>
        <l>In his bag he put the fishes.</l>
        <l>Untamo of hasty temper</l>
        <l>Then became both vexed and angry,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Untamo began to threaten</l>

        <l>Kalervoinen's son's fair consort</l>
        <l>Then was sitting near the window,</l>

        <l>"Is it smoke I see arising,</l>
        <l>Or a gloomy cloud that rises,</l>
        <l>On the borders of the cornfields,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But no dark cloud there was rising,</l>
        <l>Nor was smoke ascending thickly,</l>
        <l>But 'twas Untamo's assemblage</l>
        <l>Marching onward to the battle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On came Untamo's assemblage,</l>
        <l>In their belts their swords were hanging,</l>
        <l>Kalervo's folk overwhelming,</l>
        <l>And his mighty race they slaughtered,</l>
        <l>And they burned his house to ashes,</l>
        <l>Like a level field they made it.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Left of Kalervo's folk only</l>
        <l>But one girl, and she was pregnant;</l>
        <l>Then did Untamo's assemblage</l>
        <l>Lead her homeward on their journey,</l>
        <l>That she there might sweep the chamber,</l>
        <l>And the floor might sweep from litter.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But a little time passed over,</l>
        <l>When a little boy was born her,</l>
        <l>From a most unhappy mother,</l>
        <l>So by what name should they call him?</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>Kullervo his mother called him,</l>
        <l>Untamo, the Battle-hero.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the little boy they swaddled,</l>
        <l>And the orphan child they rested</l>
        <l>In the cradle made for rocking,</l>
        <l>That it might be rocked to lull him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So they rocked the child in cradle,</l>
        <l>Rocked it till his hair was tossing,</l>
        <l>Rocked him for one day, a second,</l>
        <l>Rocked him on the third day likewise,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>When the boy began his kicking,</l>
        <l>And he kicked and pushed about him,</l>
        <l>Tore his swaddling clothes to pieces,</l>
        <l>Freed himself from all his clothing,</l>
        <l>Then he broke the lime-wood cradle,</l>
        <l>All his rags he tore from off him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And it seemed that he would prosper,</l>
        <l>And become a man of mettle.</l>
        <l>Untamola thought already</l>
        <l>That when he was grown to manhood,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>He would grow both wise and mighty,</l>
        <l>And become a famous hero,</l>
        <l>As a servant worth a hundred,</l>
        <l>Equal to a thousand servants.</l>
        <l>Thus he grew for two and three months,</l>
        <l>But already in the third month,</l>
        <l>When a boy no more than knee-high,</l>
        <l>He began to speak in thiswise:</l>
        <l>"Presently when I am bigger,</l>
        <l>And my body shall be stronger,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>I'll avenge my father's slaughter,</l>
        <l>And my mother's tears atone for."</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>This was heard by Untamoinen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"He will bring my race to ruin,</l>
        <l>Kalervo reborn is in him."</l>
        <l>Thereupon the heroes pondered</l>
        <l>And the old crones all considered</l>
        <l>How to bring the boy to ruin,</l>
        <l>So that death might come upon him.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then they put him in a barrel,</l>
        <l>In a barrel did they thrust him,</l>
        <l>And they pushed it to the water,</l>
        <l>Pushed it out upon the billows.</l> <!--Like Bilbo barrel-rider!-->
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then they went to look about them,</l>
        <l>After two nights, after three nights,</l>
        <l>If the boy had sunk in water,</l>
        <l>Or had perished in the barrel.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the waves he was not sunken,</l>
        <l>Nor had perished in the barrel,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>He had 'scaped from out the barrel,</l>
        <l>And upon the waves was sitting,</l>
        <l>In his hand a rod of copper,</l>
        <l>At the end a line all silken,</l>
        <l>And for lake-fish he was fishing,</l>
        <l>As he floated on the water.</l>
        <l>There was water in the lakelet,</l>
        <l>Which perchance might fill two ladles,</l>
        <l>Or if more exactly measured,</l>
        <l>Partly was a third filled also.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Untamo again reflected,</l>
        <l>"How can we o'ercome the infant,</l>
        <l>That destruction come upon him,</l>
        <l>And that death may overtake him?"</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he bade his servants gather</l>
        <l>First a large supply of birch-trees,</l>
        <l>Pine-trees with their hundred needles,</l>
        <l>Trees from which the pitch was oozing,</l>
        <l>For the burning of the infant,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So they gathered and collected</l>
        <l>First a large supply of birch-trees,</l>
        <l>Pine-trees with their hundred needles,</l>
        <l>Trees from which the pitch was oozing,</l>
        <l>And of bark a thousand sledgefuls,</l>
        <l>Ash-trees, long a hundred fathoms.</l>
        <l>Fire beneath the wood they kindled,</l>
        <l>And the pyre began to crackle,</l>
        <l>And the boy they cast upon it,</l>
        <l>'Mid the glowing fire they cast him.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Burned the fire a day, a second,</l>
        <l>Burning likewise on the third day,</l>
        <l>When they went to look about them.</l>
        <l>Knee-deep sat the boy in ashes,</l>
        <l>In the embers to his elbows.</l>
        <l>In his hand he held the coal-rake,</l>
        <l>And was stirring up the fire,</l>
        <l>And he raked the coals together.</l>
        <l>Not a hair was singed upon him,</l>
        <l>Not a lock was even tangled.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Untamo grow angry.</l>
        <l>"Where then can I place the infant,</l>
        <l>That we bring him to destruction,</l>
        <l>And that death may overtake him?"</l>
        <l>So upon a tree they hanged him,</l>
        <l>Strung him up upon an oak-tree.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Two nights and a third passed over,</l>
        <l>And upon the dawn thereafter,</l>
        <l>Untamo again reflected:</l>
        <l>"Time it is to look around us,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>

        <l>Or is dead upon the gallows.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Then he sent a servant forward,</l>
        <l>Back he came, and thus reported:</l>

        <l>Nor could he be brought to ruin.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And at length he grew full weary</l>
        <l>Of his efforts to destroy him,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>So he reared up Kullervoinen</l>
        <l>As a slave beneath his orders.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon said Untamoinen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"If you live as it is fitting,</l>
        <l>Always acting as is proper,</l>
        <l>In my house I will retain you,</l>
        <l>And the work of servants give you.</l>
        <l>I will pay you wages for it,</l>
        <l>As I think that you deserve it,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>For your waist a pretty girdle,</l>
        <l>Or upon your ear a buffet.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So when Kullervo was taller,</l>
        <l>And had grown about a span-length,</l>
        <l>Then he found some work to give him,</l>
        <l>That he should prepare to labour.</l>
        <l>'Twas to rock a little infant,</l>
        <l>Rock a child with little fingers.</l>
        <l>"Watch with every care the infant,</l>
        <l>Give it food, and eat some also,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Wash his napkins in the river,</l>
        <l>Wash his little clothes and cleanse them."</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So he watched one day, a second,</l>
        <l>Broke his hands, and gouged his eyes out,</l>
        <l>And at length upon the third day,</l>
        <l>Let the infant die of sickness,</l>
        <l>Cast the napkins in the river,</l>
        <l>And he burned the baby's cradle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Untamo thereon reflected,</l>
        <l>"Such a one is quite unfitted</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>To attend to little children,</l>
        <l>Rock the babes with little fingers.</l>
        <l>Now I know not where to send him,</l>
        <l>Nor what work I ought to give him.</l>
        <l>Perhaps he ought to clear the forest?"</l>
        <l>So he went to clear the forest.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Now I first a man can deem me,</l>
        <l>When my hands the axe are wielding.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>I am handsomer to gaze on,</l>
        <l>Far more noble than aforetime,</l>
        <l>Five men's strength I feel within me</l>
        <l>And I equal six in valour."</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he went into the smithy,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou smith, my dearest brother,</l>
        <l>Forge me now a little hatchet,</l>
        <l>Such an axe as fits a hero,</l>
        <l>Iron tool for skilful workman,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>For I go to clear the forest,</l>
        <l>And to fell the slender birch-trees."</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So the smith forged what he needed,</l>
        <l>And an axe he forged him quickly;</l>
        <l>Such an axe as fits a hero,</l>
        <l>Iron tool for skilful workman.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Set to work the axe to sharpen,</l>
        <l>And he ground it in the daytime,</l>
        <l>And at evening made a handle.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he went into the forest,</l>
        <l>High upon the wooded mountains,</l>
        <l>There to seek the best of planking,</l>
        <l>And to seek the best of timber.</l>
        <l>With his axe he smote the tree-trunks,</l>
        <l>With the blade of steel he felled them,</l>
        <l>At a stroke the best he severed,</l>
        <l>And the bad ones at a half-stroke.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Five large trees at length had fallen,</l>
        <l>Eight in all he felled before him,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Lempo may the work accomplish,</l>
        <l>Hiisi now may shape the timber!.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In a stump he struck his axe-blade,</l>
        <l>And began to shout full loudly,</l>
        <l>And he piped, and then he whistled,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Let the wood be felled around me,</l>
        <l>Overthrown the slender birch-trees,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>Far as sounds my voice resounding,</l>
        <l>Far as I can send my whistle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Let no sapling here be growing,</l>
        <l>Let no blade of grass be standing,</l>
        <l>Never while the earth endureth,</l>
        <l>Or the golden moon is shining,</l>
        <l>Here in Kalervo's son's forest,</l>
        <l>Here upon the good man's clearing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"If the seed on earth has fallen,</l>
        <l>And the young corn should shoot upward,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>If the sprout should be developed,</l>
        <l>And the stalk should form upon it,</l>
        <l>May it never come to earing,</l>
        <l>Or the stalk-end be developed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the mighty Untamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wandered forth to gaze about him,</l>
        <l>Learn how Kalervo's son cleared it,</l>
        <l>And the new slave made a clearing.</l>
        <l>But he found not any clearing,</l>
        <l>And the young man had not cleared it.</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Untamo thereon reflected,</l>
        <l>"For such labour he's unsuited,</l>
        <l>He has spoiled the best of timber,</l>
        <l>And has felled the best for planking.</l>
        <l>Now I know not where to send him,</l>
        <l>Nor what work I ought to give him.</l>
        <l>Should I let him make a fencing?"</l>
        <l>So he went to make a fencing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Set himself to make a fencing,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>And for this he took whole pine-trees,</l>
        <l>And he used them for the fence-stakes,</l>
        <l>Took whole fir-trees from the forest,</l>
        <l>Wattled them to make the fencing,</l>
        <l>Bound the branches fast together</l>
        <l>With the largest mountain-ashtrees;</l>
        <l>But he made the fence continuous,</l>
        <l>And he made no gateway through it,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>"He who cannot raise him birdlike,</l>
        <l>Nor upon two wings can hover,</l>
        <l>Never may he pass across it,</l>
        <l>Over Kalervo's son's fencing!.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Untamo determine</l>
        <l>Forth to go and gaze around him,</l>
        <l>Viewing Kalervo's son's fencing</l>
        <l>By the slave of war constructed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Stood the fence without an opening</l>
        <l>Neither gap nor crevice through it,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>On the solid earth it rested,</l>
        <l>Up among the clouds it towered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"For such labour he's unsuited.</l>
        <l>Here's the fence without an opening,</l>
        <l>And without a gateway through it.</l>
        <l>Up to heaven the fence is builded,</l>
        <l>To the very clouds uprising;</l>
        <l>None can ever pass across it,</l>
        <l>Pass within through any opening.</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>Now I know not where to send him,</l>
        <l>Nor what work I ought to give him.</l>
        <l>There is rye for threshing ready."</l>
        <l>So he sent him to the threshing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Set himself to do the threshing,</l>
        <l>And the rye to chaff he pounded,</l>
        <l>Into very chaff he threshed it.</l>
        <l>Soon thereafter came the master,</l>
        <l>Strolling forth to gaze around him,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
        <l>See how Kalervo's son threshed it,</l>
        <l>And how Kullervoinen pounded.</l>
        <l>All the rye to chaff was pounded,</l>
        <l>Into very chaff he'd threshed it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Untamoinen then was angry.</l>
        <l>"As a labourer he is useless.</l>
        <l>Whatsoever work I give him,</l>
        <l>All his work he spoils from malice.</l>
        <l>Shall I take him into Russia,</l>
        <l>Shall I sell him in Carelia,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
        <l>To the smith named Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>That he there may wield the hammer?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kalervo's son took he with him,</l>
        <l>And he sold him in Carelia,</l>
        <l>To the smith named Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Skilful wielder of the hammer.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>What then gave the smith in payment?</l>
        <l>Great the payment that he made him;</l>
        <l>For he gave two worn-out kettles,</l>
        <l>And three halves of hooks he gave him,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>And five worn-out scythes he gave him,</l>
        <l>And six worn-out rakes he gave him,</l>
        <l>For a man the most unskilful,</l>
        <l>For a slave completely worthless.</l>

        <head>KULLERVO AND THE WIFE OF ILMARINEN</head>
        <div type="argument">
        The wife of Ilmarinen makes Kullervo her herdsman and maliciously bakes him a stone in his lunch (1-32). She then sends him out with the cattle, after using the usual prayers and charms for their protection from bears in the pastures (33-548).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Old man's son, with blue-dyed stockings,</l>
        <l>Finest locks of yellow colour,</l>
        <l>And with shoes of best of leather,</l>
        <l>To the smith's house went directly,</l>
        <l>Asked for work that very evening,</l>
        <l>Asked the master in the evening,</l>
        <l>And the mistress in the morning:</l>
        <l>"Give me something now to work at,</l>
        <l>Give me work that I may do it,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>Set me something now to work at,</l>
        <l>Give some work to me the wretched!"</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Pondered deeply on the matter,</l>
        <l>What the new slave could accomplish,</l>
        <l>What the new-bought wretch could work at,</l>
        <l>And she took him as her herdsman,</l>
        <l>Who should herd her flocks extensive.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the most malicious mistress,</l>
        <l>She, the smith's wife, old and jeering,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>Baked a loaf to give the herdsman,</l>
        <l>And a great cake did she bake him,</l>
        <l>Oats below and wheat above it,</l>
        <l>And between, a stone inserted.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then she spread the cake with butter,</l>
        <l>And upon the crust laid bacon,</l>
        <l>Gave it as the slave's allowance,</l>
        <l>As provision for the herdsman.</l>
        <l>She herself the slave instructed,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        <l>"Do not eat the food I give you,</l>
        <l>Till in wood the herd is driven."</l>
        </lg>

        <l>Then did Ilmarinen's housewife</l>
        <l>Send the herd away to pasture,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed her:</l>
        <l>"Send the cows among the bushes,</l>
        <l>And the milkers in the meadow,</l>

        <head>THE DEATH OF ILMARINEN'S WIFE</head>
        <div type="argument">
        While Kullervo is in the pasture in the afternoon he tries to cut the cake with his knife which he completely spoils, and this goes to his heart the more because the knife was the only remembrance left to him of his family (1-98). To revenge himself on the mistress, he drives the cattle into the marshes to be devoured by beasts of the forest, and gathers together a herd of wolves and bears, which he drives home in the evening (99-184). When the mistress goes to milk them she is torn to pieces by the wild beasts (185-296).

        <l>Drove the cows along the marshes,</l>
        <l>While across the heath he wandered,</l>
        <l>And he spoke as he was going,</l>
        <l>And repeated on his journey,</l>
        <l>"Woe to me, a youth unhappy,</l>
        <l>And a youth of wretched fortune!</l>

        <l>Then upon the ground he rested,</l>
        <l>On a sunny slope he sat him,</l>
        <l>And he then composed these verses,</l>

        </lg>

        <l>On the stone the knife struck sharply,</l>

        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Looked, and saw the knife was broken,</l>
        <l>And at length he burst out weeping,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>"Save this knife I'd no companion,</l>
        <l>Nought to love except this iron,</l>

        <l>Cawed the crow, and croaked the raven.</l>
        <l>"O thou wretched golden buckle,</l>

        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring</l>
        <l>Thus repaid the damsel's jesting,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Damsel's jesting, woman's mocking,</l>
        <l>Thus repaid the wicked woman.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Ilmarinen's wife illustrious</l>
        <l>Then herself was brought to weeping,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Ill thou dost, O wicked herdsman,</l>
        <l>Driving bears unto the homestead,</l>
        <l>To the yard these wolves gigantic.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring</l>
        <l>Heard, and thus he made her answer:</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>"Ill I did, a wicked herd-boy,</l>
        <l>Not so great as wicked mistress.</l>
        <l>In my cake a stone she baked me,</l>
        <l>Baked a lump of rock within it,</l>
        <l>On the stone my knife struck sharply,</l>
        <l>'Gainst the rock my knife was shattered;</l>
        <l>'Twas the knife of mine own father,</l>
        <l>Of our race a cherished heirloom.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Ilmarinen's housewife,</l>
        <l>"O thou herd-boy, dearest herd-boy,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>

        <l>And recall thy words of magic,</l>
        <l>And release me from the wolf's jaws,</l>
        <l>From the bear's claws now release me?</l>
        <l>Better shirts will I then give you,</l>
        <l>And will give you handsome aprons,</l>
        <l>Give you wheaten-bread, and butter,</l>
        <l>And the sweetest milk for drinking,</l>
        <l>For a year no work will give you,</l>
        <l>Give you light work in the second.</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"If you die, so may you perish,</l>
        <l>If you perish, may you perish!</l>
        <l>Room there is in earth to hold you,</l>

        <l>Then said Ilmarinen's housewife,</l>
        <l>"Ukko, thou, of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>Haste to bend thy mighty crossbow,</l>
        <l>Of thy bows the best select thou,</l>
        <l>Take thou then a bolt of copper,</l>
        <l>And adjust it to the crossbow,</l>
        <l>Shoot thou then a flaming arrow,</l>
        <l>Shoot thou forth the bolt of copper,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>Shoot it quickly through the arm-pits,</l>
        <l>Shoot it that it split the shoulders.</l>
        <l>Thus let Kalervo's son perish,</l>
        <l>Shoot thou dead this wicked creature,</l>
        <l>Shoot him with the steel-tipped arrow,</l>
        <l>Shoot him with thy bolt of copper.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Ukko, thou, of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>Shoot me not as she has prayed thee,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>Shoot the wife of Ilmarinen,</l>

        <l>Or can move herself from off it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Ilmarinen's housewife,</l>
        <l>Wife of that most skilful craftsman,</l>
        <l>On the spot at once fall dying,</l>
        <l>Fell, as falls the soot from kettle,</l>
        <l>In the yard before her homestead,</l>

        <l>Whom the smith so long had yearned for,</l>
        <l>And for six long years was sought for,</l>
        <l>As the joy of Ilmarinen,</l>

        Kullervo escapes from the homestead of Ilmarinen, and wanders sorrowfully through the forest, where he meets with the Old Woman of the Forest, who informs him that his father, mother, brothers and sisters are still living (1-128). Following her directions he finds them on the borders of Lapland (129-188). His mother tells him that she had long supposed him to be dead, and also that her elder daughter had been lost when gathering berries (189-246).

        <l>Kullervo still wandered onwards,</l>

        <l>Shoes of ice to wear they left me,</l>

        <l>"In my mind the thought has entered,</l>

        <l>Forth I went, unhappy mother,</l>
        <l>Forth I went to seek my daughter,</l>
        <l>Through the wood like bear I hurried,</l>
        <l>Speeding through the wastes like otter,</l>
        <l>Thus I sought one day, a second,</l>
        <l>Sought her also on the third day.</l>
        <l>When the third day had passed over,</l>
        <l>For a long time yet I wandered,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Till I reached a mighty mountain,</l>

        <head>KULLERVO AND HIS SISTER</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Kullervo attempts to do different kinds of work for his parents, but only succeeds in spoiling everything, so his father sends him to pay the land-dues (1-68). On his way home he meets his sister who was lost gathering berries, whom he drags into his sledge (69-188). Afterwards, when his sister learns who he is, she throws herself into a torrent, but Kullervo hurries home, relates his sister's terrible fate to his mother, and proposes to put an end to his own life (189-344). His mother dissuades him from suicide, and advises him to retire to some retreat where he may be able to recover from his remorse. But Kullervo resolves before all things to avenge himself on Untamo (345-372).

        <l>Ribs of juniper he shattered,</l>

        <head>THE DEATH OF KULLERVO</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Kullervo prepares for war and leaves home joyfully, for no one but his mother is sorry that he is going to his death (1-154). He comes to Untamola, lays waste the whole district, and burns the homestead (155-250). On returning home he finds his home deserted, and no living thing about the place but an old black dog, with which he goes into the forest to shoot game for food (251-296). While traversing the forest he arrives at the place where he met his sister, and ends his remorse by killing himself with his own sword (297-360).

        <lg>
        <l>Through the meadows marched he shouting,</l>
        <l>In the grassfields he was shouting,</l>
        <l>And a messenger o'ertook him,</l>
        <l>In his ear these words he whispered:</l>
        <l>"Now has died thy tender mother,</l>
        <l>And thy darling mother perished.</l>
        <l>Now return to gaze upon her,</l>
        <l>And arrange for her interment."</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Woe to me, a youth unhappy,</l>
        <l>For my mother now has perished,</l>
        <l>Wearied as she made the curtains,</l>
        <l>And the counterpane embroidered.</l>
        <l>With her long spool she was working,</l>
        <l>As she turned around her spindle.</l>
        <l>I was not at her departure,</l>
        <l>Near her when her soul was parting.</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Perhaps the cold was great and killed her,</l>
        <l>Or perchance was bread too scanty.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"In the house with care, O wash her,</l>
        <l>With the Saxon soap, the finest,</l>
        <l>Wind her then in silken wrappings,</l>
        <l>Wrap her in the finest linen,</l>
        <l>Thus unto the grave convey her,</l>
        <l>Sink her gently down to Kalma,</l>
        <l>Then upraise the songs of mourning,</l>
        <l>Let resound the songs of mourning,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>For not yet can I turn homeward,</l>
        <l>Untamo is still unfallen,</l>
        <l>Yet unfelled the man of evil,</l>
        <l>Undestroyed is yet the villain.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Forth he went to battle, playing,</l>
        <l>Went to Untola rejoicing,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Ukko, thou, of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>Give me now a sword befitting,</l>
        <l>Give me now a sword most splendid,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>Which were worth an army to me,</l>
        <l>Though a hundred came against me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the sword he asked was granted,</l>
        <l>And a sword of all most splendid,</l>
        <l>And he slaughtered all the people,</l>
        <l>Untamo's whole tribe he slaughtered,</l>
        <l>Burned the houses all to ashes,</l>
        <l>And with flame completely burned them,</l>
        <l>Leaving nothing but the hearthstones,</l>
        <l>Nought but in each yard the rowan.</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>

        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Then to his own home retired,</l>
        <l>To his father's former dwelling,</l>
        <l>To the home-fields of his parents.</l>
        <l>Empty did he find the homestead,</l>
        <l>Desolate the open places;</l>
        <l>No one forward came to greet him,</l>
        <l>No one came his hand to offer.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the hearth he stretched his hand out,</l>
        <l>On the hearth the coals were frozen,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>And he knew on his arrival,</l>
        <l>That his mother was not living.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the stove he stretched his hand out,</l>
        <l>At the stove the stones were frozen,</l>
        <l>And he knew on his arrival,</l>
        <l>That his father was not living.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the floor his eyes then casting,</l>
        <l>All he noticed in confusion,</l>
        <l>And he knew on his arrival,</l>
        <l>That his sister was not living.</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the mooring-place he hastened,</l>
        <l>But no boats were at their moorings,</l>
        <l>And he knew on his arrival,</l>
        <l>That his brother was not living.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon he broke out weeping,</l>
        <l>And he wept one day, a second,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O my mother, O my dearest,</l>
        <l>Hast thou left me nought behind thee,</l>
        <l>When thou livedst in this country?</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"But thou hearest not, O mother,</l>
        <l>Even though my eyes are sobbing,</l>
        <l>And my temples are lamenting,</l>
        <l>And my head is all complaining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the grave his mother wakened,</l>
        <l>And beneath the mould made answer:</l>
        <l>"Still there lives the black dog, Musti,</l>
        <l>Go with him into the forest,</l>
        <l>At thy side let him attend thee,</l>
        <l>Take him to the wooded country,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>Where the forest rises thickest,</l>
        <l>Where reside the forest-maidens,</l>
        <l>Where the Blue Maids have their dwelling,</l>
        <l>And the birds frequent the pine-trees,</l>
        <l>There to seek for their assistance,</l>
        <l>And to seek to win their favour.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>At his side the black dog taking,</l>
        <l>Tracked his path through trees of forest,</l>
        <l>Where the forest rose the thickest.</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>But a short way had he wandered,</l>
        <l>But a little way walked onward,</l>
        <l>When he reached the stretch of forest,</l>
        <l>Recognized the spot before him,</l>
        <l>Where he had seduced the maiden,</l>
        <l>And his mother's child dishonoured.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>There the tender grass was weeping,</l>
        <l>And the lovely spot lamenting,</l>
        <l>And the young grass was deploring,</l>
        <l>And the flowers of heath were grieving,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>For the ruin of the maiden,</l>
        <l>For the mother's child's destruction.</l>
        <l>Neither was the young grass sprouting,</l>
        <l>Nor the flowers of heath expanding,</l>
        <l>Nor the spot had covered over,</l>
        <l>Where the evil thing had happened,</l>
        <l>Where he had seduced the maiden,</l>
        <l>And his mother's child dishonoured.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>Grasped the sharpened sword he carried,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>Looked upon the sword and turned it,</l>
        <l>And he questioned it and asked it,</l>
        <l>And he asked the sword's opinion,</l>
        <l>If it was disposed to slay him,</l>
        <l>To devour his guilty body,</l>
        <l>And his evil blood to swallow.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Understood the sword his meaning,</l>
        <l>Understood the hero's question,</l>
        <l>And it answered him as follows:</l>
        <l>"Wherefore at thy heart's desire</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>Should I not thy flesh devour,</l>
        <l>And drink up thy blood so evil?</l>
        <l>I who guiltless flesh have eaten,</l>
        <l>Drank the blood of those who sinned not?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
        <l>With the very bluest stockings,</l>
        <l>On the ground the haft set firmly,</l>
        <l>On the heath the hilt pressed tightly,</l>
        <l>Turned the point against his bosom,</l>
        <l>And upon the point he threw him,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>Thus he found the death he sought for,</l>
        <l>Cast himself into destruction.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Even so the young man perished,</l>
        <l>Thus died Kullervo the hero,</l>
        <l>Thus the hero's life was ended,</l>
        <l>Perished thus the hapless hero.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>When he heard that he had perished,</l>
        <l>And that Kullervo had fallen,</l>
        <l>Spoke his mind in words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
        <l>"Never, people, in the future,</l>
        <l>Rear a child in crooked fashion,</l>
        <l>Rocking them in stupid fashion,</l>
        <l>Soothing them to sleep like strangers.</l>

        <head>THE GOLD AND SILVER BRIDE</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Ilmarinen weeps long for his dead wife and then forges himself a wife of gold and silver with great labour and trouble (1-162). At night he rests by the golden bride, but finds in the morning that the side which he has turned towards her is quite cold (163-196). He offers his golden bride to Väinämöinen, who declines to receive her, and advises him to forge more useful things, or to send her to other countries where people wish for gold (197-250).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Afterwards smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Mourned his wife throughout the evenings,</l>
        <l>And through sleepless nights was weeping,</l>
        <l>All the days bewailed her fasting,</l>
        <l>And he mourned her all the mornings,</l>
        <l>In the morning hours lamented,</l>
        <l>Since the time his young wife perished,</l>
        <l>Death the fair one had o'ertaken.</l>
        <l>In his hand he swung no longer,</l>
        <l>Copper handle of his hammer,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>Nor his hammer's clang resounded,</l>
        <l>While a month its course was running.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"Hapless youth, I know no longer,</l>
        <l>How to pass my sad existence,</l>
        <l>For at night I sit and sleep not,</l>
        <l>Always in the night comes sorrow,</l>
        <l>And my strength grows weak from trouble.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"All my evenings now are weary,</l>
        <l>Sorrowful are all my mornings,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>And the nights indeed are dismal,</l>
        <l>Worst of all when I am waking.</l>
        <l>Grieve I not because 'tis evening,</l>
        <l>Sorrow not because 'tis morning,</l>
        <l>Trouble not for other seasons;</l>
        <l>But I sorrow for my fair one,</l>
        <l>And I sorrow for my dear one,</l>
        <l>Grieve for her, the dark-browed beauty.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Sometimes in these times so dismal,</l>
        <l>Often in my time of trouble,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        <l>Often in my dreams at midnight,</l>
        <l>Has my hand felt out at nothing,</l>
        <l>And my hand seized only trouble,</l>
        <l>As it strayed about in strangeness.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus the smith awhile lived wifeless,</l>
        <l>And without his wife grew older,</l>
        <l>Wept for two months and for three months,</l>
        <l>But upon the fourth month after,</l>
        <l>Gold from out the lake he gathered,</l>
        <l>Gathered silver from the billows,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
        <l>And a pile of wood collected,</l>
        <l>Nothing short of thirty sledgeloads,</l>
        <l>Then he burned the wood to charcoal,</l>
        <l>Took the charcoal to the smithy.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Of the gold he took a portion,</l>
        <l>And he chose him out some silver,</l>
        <l>Even like a ewe of autumn,</l>
        <l>Even like a hare of winter,</l>
        <l>And the gold to redness heated,</l>
        <l>Cast the silver in the furnace,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>Set his slaves to work the bellows,</l>

        <l>And by day he worked unresting.</l>
        <l>Feet he fashioned for the maiden,</l>
        <l>Fashioned feet; and hands he made her,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>But the feet would not support her,</l>
        <l>Neither would the arms embrace him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Ears he fashioned for the maiden,</l>
        <l>But the ears served not for hearing,</l>
        <l>And a dainty mouth he made her,</l>
        <l>Tender mouth and shining eyeballs,</l>
        <l>But the mouth served not for speaking,</l>
        <l>And the eyes served not for smiling.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>"She would be a pretty maiden,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>If she had the art of speaking,</l>
        <l>And had sense, and spoke discreetly.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this he laid the maiden</l>
        <l>On the softest of the blankets,</l>
        <l>Smoothed for her the softest pillows,</l>
        <l>On the silken bed he laid her.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Quickly warmed the steaming bath-room,</l>
        <l>Took the soap into the bath-room,</l>
        <l>And provided twigs for bath-whisks,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>And of water took three tubs full,</l>
        <l>That the little finch should wash her,</l>
        <l>And the little goldfinch cleanse her,</l>
        <l>Cleanse her beauty from the ashes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When the smith had also bathed him,</l>
        <l>Washed him to his satisfaction,</l>
        <l>At the maiden's side he stretched him,</l>
        <l>On the softest of the blankets,</l>
        <l>'Neath the steel-supported hangings,</l>
        <l>'Neath the over-arching iron.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Even on the very first night,</l>
        <l>Asked for coverlets in plenty,</l>
        <l>And for blankets to protect him,</l>
        <l>Also two and three of bearskins,</l>
        <l>Five or six of woollen mantles,</l>
        <l>All upon one side to lay him,</l>
        <l>That towards the golden image.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And one side had warmth sufficient</l>
        <l>Which was covered by the bedclothes;</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>That beside the youthful damsel,</l>
        <l>Turned towards the golden image,</l>
        <l>All that side was fully frozen,</l>
        <l>And with frost was quite contracted,</l>
        <l>Like the ice on lake when frozen,</l>
        <l>Frozen into stony hardness.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"This is not so pleasant for me.</l>
        <l>I will take the maid to Väinö,</l>
        <l>Pass her on to Väinämöinen,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>On his knee as wife to seat her,</l>
        <l>Dovelike in his arms to nestle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So to Väinölä he took her,</l>
        <l>And he said upon his coming,</l>
        <l>In the very words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Here I bring a damsel for you,</l>
        <l>And a damsel fair to gaze on,</l>
        <l>And her mouth gapes not too widely,</l>
        <l>And her chin is not too broadened."</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Looked upon the golden image,</l>
        <l>Looked upon her head all golden,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Wherefore have you brought her to me,</l>
        <l>Brought to me this golden spectre?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"With the best intent I brought her,</l>
        <l>On your knee as wife to rest her,</l>
        <l>Dovelike in your arms to nestle."</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"O thou smith, my dearest brother,</l>
        <l>Thrust the damsel in the furnace,</l>
        <l>Forge all sorts of objects from her,</l>
        <l>Or convey her hence to Russia,</l>
        <l>Take your image to the Saxons,</l>
        <l>Since they wed the spoils of battle,</l>
        <l>And they woo in fiercest combat;</l>
        <l>But it suits not my position,</l>
        <l>Nor to me myself is suited,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Thus to woo a bride all golden,</l>
        <l>Or distress myself for silver.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then dissuaded Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>And forbade the wave-sprung hero,</l>
        <l>All the rising generation,</l>
        <l>Likewise those upgrown already,</l>
        <l>For the sake of gold to bow them,</l>
        <l>Or debase themselves for silver,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>"Never, youths, however wretched,</l>
        <l>Nor in future, upgrown heroes,</l>
        <l>Whether you have large possessions,</l>
        <l>Or are poor in your possessions,</l>
        <l>In the course of all your lifetime,</l>
        <l>While the golden moon is shining,</l>
        <l>May you woo a golden woman,</l>
        <l>Or distress yourselves for silver,</l>
        <l>For the gleam of gold is freezing,</l>
        <l>Only frost is breathed by silver."</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>

        <head>ILMARINEN'S NEW BRIDE FROM POHJOLA</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Ilmarinen goes to Pohjola to woo the younger sister of his first wife, but as he receives only insulting words in reply, he becomes angry, seizes the maiden, and starts on his homeward journey (1-124). On the way the maiden treats Ilmarinen with contempt, and provokes him till he changes her into a seagull (125-286). When Ilmarinen comes home, he relates to Väinämöinen how the inhabitants of Pohjola live free from care since they possessed the Sampo; and also tells him how badly his wooing has prospered (287-328).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
        <l>Cast away the golden image,</l>
        <l>Cast away the silver damsel,</l>
        <l>Afterwards his horse he harnessed,</l>
        <l>Yoked before the sledge the chestnut,</l>
        <l>On the sledge himself he mounted,</l>
        <l>And within the sledge he sat him,</l>
        <l>And departed on his journey,</l>
        <l>And proposed, as he was driving,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>He to Pohjola would travel,</l>
        <l>There to ask another daughter.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So he drove for one day onward,</l>
        <l>Journeyed also on the second,</l>
        <l>And at length upon the third day,</l>
        <l>Came to Pohjola's broad courtyard.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
        <l>Came into the yard to meet him,</l>
        <l>And began the conversation,</l>
        <l>And she turned to him and asked him</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>How her child's health was at present,</l>
        <l>If her daughter was contented,</l>

        </lg>

        <l>Head bowed down, and deeply grieving,</l>
        <l>And his cap all sloping sideways,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Do thou not, O mother, ask me,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Ill have I, unhappy, acted,</l>
        <l>And it was a sad misfortune</l>
        <l>When to thee my child I promised,</l>

        <l>And she scratch the soot from off you,</l>
        <l>Sooner would I give my daughter,</l>
        <l>And would give my tender daughter,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>To the fiercely-foaming cataract,</l>

        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Mouth and head both turning sideways,</l>
        <l>With his black hair in disorder,</l>
        <l>As his head he shook in anger,</l>
        <l>Pushed his way into the chamber,</l>
        <l>And beneath the roof he entered,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Come thou now with me, O maiden,</l>
        <l>In the station of thy sister,</l>
        <l>And to occupy her dwelling,</l>
        <l>Cakes of honey there to bake me,</l>
        <l>And the best of ale to brew me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the floor there sang a baby,</l>
        <l>Thus he sang, and thus made answer:</l>
        <l>"Quit our castle, guest unwelcome,</l>
        <l>From our doors, O stranger, hasten!</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>Thou before hast harmed our castle,</l>
        <l>Evil much hast wrought our castle,</l>
        <l>When the first time here thou camest,</l>
        <l>And within our doors hast entered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Maiden, O my dearest sister,</l>
        <l>O rejoice not in this lover,</l>
        <l>Neither in his mouth so subtle,</l>
        <l>Neither in his feet well-shapen,</l>
        <l>For his gums are like a wolf's gums,</l>
        <l>Curved his claws like those of foxes,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>And the claws of bears conceals he,</l>

        <l>And whose form is far more handsome,</l>
        <l>In a finer sledge to take me,</l>
        <l>To a larger, finer dwelling,</l>
        <l>To a better home than thou hast,</l>

        <l>Mouth and head both turning sideways,</l>
        <l>And his black hair in disorder,</l>
        <l>Seized without ado the maiden,</l>
        <l>In his grasp he seized the maiden,</l>
        <l>From the room he rushed like snowstorm,</l>
        <l>Dragged her where his sledge was standing,</l>
        <l>In the sledge he pushed the maiden,</l>
        <l>And within the sledge he cast her,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>Started quickly on his journey,</l>
        <l>And prepared him for his journey,</l>
        <l>With one hand the horse he guided,</l>
        <l>On the girl's breast laid the other.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Wept the maiden and lamented,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Now I come where grow the cranberries,</l>

        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Bit his lips, his head turned sideways,</l>
        <l>And the sledge drove rattling onward,</l>
        <l>And a little way they journeyed,</l>
        <l>When the horse pricked ears to listen,</l>
        <l>And the long-eared steed was shying.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then her head the maiden lifted,</l>
        <l>In the snow she saw fresh footprints,</l>
        <l>And she thereupon inquired,</l>
        <l>"What has passed across our pathway?"</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"'Twas a fox that ran across it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the hapless girl was sighing,</l>
        <l>Much she sobbed, and much was sighing,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Woe to me, unhappy creature,</l>
        <l>Better surely had I found it,</l>
        <l>And my lot were surely better,</l>
        <l>Were I riding in a fox-sledge,</l>
        <l>And in Lapland sledge were fleeing,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Than in sledge of such a suitor,</l>
        <l>'Neath the rug of one so wrinkled,</l>

        <l>And his mouth-cleft is more handsome.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Bit his lips, his head turned sideways,</l>
        <l>And the sledge drove rattling onward,</l>
        <l>And a little way they journeyed,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"'Twas a wolf that ran across it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the hapless girl was sighing,</l>
        <l>Much she sobbed, and much was sighing,</l>

        <l>Better surely had I found it,</l>
        <l>And my lot were surely better</l>
        <l>If a growling wolf I followed,</l>
        <l>Tracked the pathway of the Snouted,</l>
        <l>Than in sledge of such a suitor,</l>
        <l>'Neath the rug of one so wrinkled,</l>
        <l>For the hair of wolf is finer,</l>
        <l>And his mouth-cleft is more handsome.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Bit his lips, his head turned sideways,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>And the sledge drove rattling onwards,</l>
        <l>And at night they reached a village.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>With the journey overwearied,</l>
        <l>Slept the smith, and slept profoundly,</l>
        <l>And another than her husband</l>
        <l>Made the girl laugh as he slept there.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>In the morning when he wakened,</l>
        <l>Mouth and head both twisted sideways,</l>
        <l>Tossed his black hair in disorder.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this, smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Pondered till he spoke as follows:</l>
        <l>"Shall I now commence my singing,</l>
        <l>Shall I sing a bride like this one,</l>
        <l>To a creature of the forest,</l>
        <l>Or a creature of the water.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Not to forest beast I'll sing her,</l>
        <l>All the forest would be troubled;</l>
        <l>Neither to a water-creature,</l>
        <l>Lest the fishes all should shun her;</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>Better slay her with my hanger,</l>
        <l>With my sword will I despatch her.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the sword perceived his object,</l>
        <l>Understood the hero's language,</l>
        <l>And it spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Not for this was I constructed,</l>
        <l>That I should despatch the women,</l>
        <l>And the weak I thus should slaughter.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Presently commenced his singing,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>And began to speak in anger,</l>
        <l>Sung his wife into a seamew,</l>
        <l>Thenceforth round the cliffs to clamour,</l>
        <l>Scream upon the rocks in water,</l>
        <l>Moan around the jutting headlands,</l>
        <l>Struggle with the winds against her.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>In his sledge again dashed forward,</l>
        <l>And the sledge drove rattling onward,</l>
        <l>Head bowed down in great depression,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>Back he journeyed to his country,</l>
        <l>Till he reached the well-known regions.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Came upon the road to meet him,</l>
        <l>And began to speak as follows:</l>
        <l>"Ilmarinen, smith and brother,</l>
        <l>Wherefore is your mood so gloomy,</l>
        <l>Wherefore is your cap pushed sideways,</l>
        <l>As from Pohjola thou comest?</l>
        <l>How at Pohjola exist they?"</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"How at Pohjola exist they?</l>
        <l>There the Sampo grinds for ever,</l>
        <l>And revolves the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>And one day it grinds provisions,</l>
        <l>Grinds for sale upon the second,</l>
        <l>On the third what needs the household.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Thus I speak, and tell you truly,</l>
        <l>And again repeat it to you,</l>
        <l>How at Pohjola exist they,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>When at Pohjola's the Sampo!</l>
        <l>There is ploughing, there is sowing,</l>
        <l>There is every kind of increase,</l>
        <l>And their welfare is eternal.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"Ilmarinen, smith and brother,</l>
        <l>Where hast thou thy wife abandoned,</l>
        <l>Where thy youthful bride so famous,</l>
        <l>That you here return without her,</l>
        <l>Ever driving homeward wifeless?"</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Such a wife she was, I sang her</l>
        <l>To the sea-cliffs as a seamew;</l>
        <l>Now she screams aloud as seagull,</l>
        <l>Shrieks aloud without cessation,</l>
        <l>Moans about the rocks in water,</l>
        <l>And around the cliffs she clamours.</l>

        <head>THE EXPEDITION AGAINST POHJOLA</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Väinämöinen persuades Ilmarinen to go with him to Pohjola to bring away the Sampo. Ilmarinen consents, and the heroes start off on their journey in a boat (1-330).

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

        <l>Unto Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
        <l>And within the hill of copper.</l>
        <l>There by nine locks is it fastened,</l>
        <l>And three roots have sprouted from it,</l>
        <l>Firmly fixed, nine fathoms deeply.</l>

        <l>Lempo on the lake is brooding,</l>
        <l>Death upon its mighty surface,</l>

        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"Safest is by land the journey,</l>
        <l>Safest, but the most fatiguing,</l>
        <l>And moreover, full of windings.</l>
        <l>Pleasant 'tis in boat on water,</l>
        <l>Swaying as the boat glides onward,</l>
        <l>Gliding o'er the sparkling water,</l>
        <l>Driving o'er its shining surface,</l>

        <l>While the west-wind rocks it gently,</l>
        <l>And the south-wind drives it onward,</l>
        <l>But let this be as it may be,</l>
        <l>If you do not like the lake-voyage,</l>
        <l>We by land can journey thither,</l>
        <l>And along the shore can journey.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"First a new sword do you forge me,</l>
        <l>Make me now a keen-edged weapon,</l>
        <l>So that I with beasts can struggle,</l>
        <l>Chase away the folks of Pohja.</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>Forth I go to seize the Sampo,</l>

        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
        <l>Cast some iron in the fire,</l>
        <l>Steel upon the glowing charcoal,</l>
        <l>And of gold he took a handful,</l>
        <l>And of silver took a handful,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>Set the slaves to work the bellows,</l>
        <l>And he made the labourers press them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Worked the slaves the bellows strongly,</l>
        <l>Well the labourers pressed the bellows,</l>

        <l>And the silver shone like water,</l>
        <l>And the gold swelled up like billows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>Stooped to look into the furnace,</l>
        <l>At the edges of the bellows,</l>
        <l>And he saw a sword was forming,</l>
        <l>With a hilt of gold constructed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the fire he took the weapon,</l>
        <l>Took the work so finely fashioned,</l>
        <l>From the furnace to the anvil,</l>
        <l>To the hammer and the mallet,</l>
        <l>Forged the sword as he would wish it,</l>
        <l>And a blade the best of any,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>And with finest gold inlaid it,</l>
        <l>And with silver he adorned it.</l>

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Entered then to view the weapon,</l>
        <l>And he found a keen-edged sword-blade.</l>
        <l>Straightway in his hand he raised it,</l>
        <l>And he turned it and surveyed it,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Does this sword befit a hero,</l>
        <l>Is the sword to bearer suited?"</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>And the sword the hero suited.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Well did it befit the bearer.</l>
        <l>On its point the moon was shining,</l>
        <l>On its side the sun was shining,</l>
        <l>On the haft the stars were gleaming,</l>
        <l>At the tip a horse was neighing,</l>
        <l>On the knob a cat was mewing,</l>
        <l>On the sheath a dog was barking.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this the sword he brandished,</l>
        <l>And he cleft an iron mountain,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Thus, with such a blade as this is,</l>
        <l>Can I cleave the mountains open,</l>
        <l>Cleave the rocky hills asunder.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this did Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Speak aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"How shall I myself, unhappy,</l>
        <l>How shall I, the weak, defend me,</l>
        <l>And shall armour me, and belt me,</l>
        <l>'Gainst the risks of land and water?</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>Shall I clothe myself in armour,</l>
        <l>In a coat of mail the strongest,</l>
        <l>Gird a belt of steel around me?</l>
        <l>Stronger is a man in armour,</l>
        <l>In a coat of mail is better,</l>
        <l>With a belt of steel more mighty.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then arrived the time for starting,</l>
        <l>And preparing for departure;</l>
        <l>First the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Secondly smith Ilmarinen,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>And they went to seek the courser,</l>
        <l>And to find the yellow-maned one,</l>
        <l>And the one-year old to bridle,</l>
        <l>And to see the foal was rough-shod.</l>
        <l>Then they went to seek the courser,</l>
        <l>Went to seek him in the forest,</l>
        <l>And they gazed around them keenly,</l>
        <l>And they sought around the blue wood,</l>
        <l>Found the horse among the bushes,</l>
        <l>Found the yellow-maned in firwood.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Secondly smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>On his head the bit adjusted,</l>
        <l>And the one-year old they bridled,</l>
        <l>And they drove upon their journey.</l>
        <l>On the shore drove both the heroes,</l>
        <l>On the shore they heard lamenting,</l>
        <l>From the haven heard complaining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>"Perhaps it is a girl complaining,</l>
        <l>Or perchance a dove lamenting.</l>
        <l>Shall we go to look about us,</l>
        <l>Shall we nearer go to listen?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Therefore to the spot they sauntered,</l>
        <l>Nearer went to gaze around them,</l>
        <l>But no maiden there was weeping,</l>
        <l>And no dove was there lamenting,</l>
        <l>But they found a vessel weeping,</l>
        <l>And a boat was there lamenting.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>As he went towards the vessel,</l>
        <l>"Wherefore weep, O wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Boat with rowlocks, why lamentest?</l>
        <l>Dost thou weep that thou art clumsy,</l>
        <l>And art dreaming at thy moorings?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the wooden boat made answer,</l>
        <l>Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l>
        <l>"Know, a vessel longs for water,</l>
        <l>And its tarry sides desire it,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>As a maiden may be longing</l>
        <l>For the fine home of a husband.</l>
        <l>Therefore weeps the boat unhappy,</l>
        <l>And the hapless boat lamenteth,</l>
        <l>And I weep to speed through water,</l>
        <l>And to float upon the billows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"It was said when I was fashioned,</l>
        <l>When my boards were sung together,</l>
        <l>That I should become a warship,</l>
        <l>And should be employed for warboat,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>And should bear the plunder homeward,</l>
        <l>In my hold should carry treasure,</l>
        <l>But I have not been in battle,</l>
        <l>Neither have been stored with plunder.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Other boats, and even bad ones,</l>
        <l>Always wander forth to battle,</l>
        <l>And are led to battle-struggle</l>
        <l>Three times in the course of summer,</l>
        <l>And return with money loaded,</l>
        <l>In their hold they carry treasure,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>But for me, though well constructed,</l>
        <l>Of a hundred boards constructed,</l>
        <l>Here upon my rests I'm rotting,</l>
        <l>Lying idly at my moorings,</l>
        <l>And the worst worms of the country</l>
        <l>Underneath my ribs are lurking,</l>
        <l>While the birds, of all most horrid,</l>
        <l>In my masts their nests are building,</l>
        <l>All the toads from out the forest</l>
        <l>Over all my deck are leaping.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>Twice it had been better for me,</l>
        <l>Two or three times were it better</l>
        <l>Had I been a mountain pine-tree,</l>
        <l>Or upon the heath a fir-tree,</l>
        <l>With a squirrel in my branches,</l>
        <l>Underneath my boughs a puppy.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Do not weep, O wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Fret thyself, O boat with rowlocks!</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>Soon shalt thou go forth to battle,</l>
        <l>There to mix in furious conflict.</l>
        <l>Boat, who wast by builder fashioned,</l>
        <l>'Twas this gift the builder gave thee,</l>
        <l>That thy prow should reach the water,</l>
        <l>And thy sides the billows traverse,</l>
        <l>Even though no hand should touch thee,</l>
        <l>Neither arm be thrust against thee,</l>
        <l>Though no shoulder should direct thee,</l>
        <l>And although no arm should guide thee."</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then replied the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Answered thus the boat with rowlocks:</l>
        <l>"None of all my race so mighty,</l>
        <l>Neither will the boats, my brothers,</l>
        <l>Move unpushed into the water,</l>
        <l>Nor unrowed upon the billows,</l>
        <l>If no hand is laid upon us,</l>
        <l>And no arm should urge us forward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"If I push you in the water,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Will you make, unrowed, your journey,</l>
        <l>Unassisted by the oars,</l>
        <l>By the rudder undirected,</l>
        <l>When the sails no breeze is filling?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answer made the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l>
        <l>"None of all my race so noble,</l>
        <l>Nor the host of other vessels,</l>
        <l>Speed along unrowed by fingers,</l>
        <l>Unassisted by the oars,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>By the rudder undirected,</l>
        <l>When the sails no breeze is filling.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Can you speed if some one rows you,</l>
        <l>If assisted by the oars,</l>
        <l>By the rudder if directed,</l>
        <l>When the sails the breeze is filling?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered then the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>"Yes, my race would hasten onward,</l>
        <l>All the other boats my brothers,</l>
        <l>Speed along if rowed by fingers,</l>
        <l>If assisted by the oars,</l>
        <l>By the rudder if directed,</l>
        <l>When the sails the breeze is filling.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Left his horse upon the sandhills,</l>
        <l>On a tree he fixed the halter,</l>
        <l>Tied the reins upon the branches,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>Pushed the boat into the water,</l>
        <l>Sang the vessel in the billows,</l>
        <l>And he asked the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou boat, of shape so curving,</l>
        <l>O thou wooden boat with rowlocks,</l>
        <l>Art thou just as fit to bear us,</l>
        <l>As thyself art fair to gaze on?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered thus the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>"I am fitted well to bear you,</l>
        <l>And my floor is very spacious,</l>
        <l>And a hundred men might row me,</l>
        <l>And a thousand others stand there.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Softly then began to carol,</l>
        <l>Sang on one side of the vessel</l>
        <l>Handsome youths, with hair brushed smoothly,</l>
        <l>Hair smoothed down and hands all hardened,</l>
        <l>And their feet were finely booted;</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>Sang on other side of vessel</l>
        <l>Girls with tin upon their head-dress,</l>
        <l>Head-dress tin, and belts of copper,</l>
        <l>Golden rings upon their fingers;</l>
        <l>And again sang Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Till the seats were full of people,</l>
        <l>Some were very aged people,</l>
        <l>Men whose lives were nearly over,</l>
        <l>But for these the space was scanty,</l>
        <l>For the young folks came before them.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the stern himself he seated,</l>
        <l>Sat behind the birchwood vessel,</l>
        <l>And he steered the vessel onward,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Speed thou on through treeless regions,</l>
        <l>O'er the wide expanse of water,</l>
        <l>O'er the lake do thou float lightly,</l>
        <l>As on waves a water-lily.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he set the youths to rowing,</l>
        <l>But he left the maidens resting;</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>Rowed the youths, and bent the oars,</l>
        <l>Yet the vessel moved not onward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he set the girls to rowing,</l>
        <l>But he left the youths reposing;</l>
        <l>Rowed the girls, and bent their fingers,</l>
        <l>Yet the vessel moved not onward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the old folks set to rowing,</l>
        <l>While the young folks gazed upon them;</l>
        <l>Rowed they till their heads were shaking,</l>
        <l>Still the vessel moved not onward.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Sat him down, and set to rowing;</l>
        <l>Now moved on the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Sped the boat and made good progress,</l>
        <l>Far was heard the splash of oars,</l>
        <l>Far the splashing of the rudder.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On he rowed, while splashed the water,</l>
        <l>Cracked the seats, and shook the planking,</l>
        <l>Clashed the mountain-ashwood oars,</l>
        <l>Creaked like hazel-grouse the rudders,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>And their tips like cry of blackcock.</l>
        <l>Like a swan the prow clove onward,</l>
        <l>Croaked the stern as croaks a raven,</l>
        <l>Hissed the rowlocks just as geese hiss.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Steered the vessel quickly onward,</l>
        <l>From the stern of the red vessel,</l>
        <l>With the aid of the strong rudder,</l>
        <l>Till they saw a cliff before them,</l>
        <l>And perceived a wretched village.</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the cape was Ahti dwelling,</l>
        <l>In its bend was Kauko living,</l>
        <l>Weeping that the fish had failed him,</l>
        <l>Weeping that the bread had failed him;</l>
        <l>For the smallness of his storehouse,</l>
        <l>Wept the scamp his wretched fortune.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>At a boat's planks he was working,</l>
        <l>At a new boat's keel was working,</l>
        <l>On this hungry promontory,</l>
        <l>And beside the wretched village.</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Very keen was Ahti's hearing,</l>
        <l>But his sight was even keener;</l>
        <l>As he gazed afar to north-west,</l>
        <l>And to south his head was turning,</l>
        <l>Suddenly he saw a rainbow,</l>
        <l>And a single cloud beyond it;</l>
        <l>What he saw was not a rainbow,</l>
        <l>Nor a little cloud beyond it;</l>
        <l>But a boat that speeded swiftly,</l>
        <l>And a vessel rushing onward</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
        <l>O'er the broad lake's shining surface,</l>
        <l>Out upon the open water,</l>
        <l>In the stern a noble hero,</l>
        <l>And a handsome man was rowing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"What this boat may be I know not,</l>
        <l>Whose may be this handsome vessel,</l>
        <l>Which is hither rowed from Suomi,</l>
        <l>From the east, with strokes of oars,</l>
        <l>And its rudder to the north-west."</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then with all his might he shouted,</l>
        <l>Shouted, and continued shouting,</l>
        <l>From the cape the hero shouted,</l>
        <l>Shouted loudly o'er the water,</l>
        <l>"Whose the boat that cleaves the water,</l>
        <l>Whose the vessel on the billows?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the boat the men made answer,</l>
        <l>And the women answered likewise,</l>
        <l>"Who art thou, O forest-dweller,</l>
        <l>Hero, breaking through the thicket,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>That thou dost not know this vessel,</l>
        <l>Whose from Väinöla this vessel,</l>

        <l>Nor the hero at the oars?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"Now do I perceive the steersman,</l>
        <l>And I recognize the oarsman.</l>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>In the vessel's stern is sitting,</l>
        <l>Ilmarinen at the oars.</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>Whither then away, O heroes,</l>
        <l>Whither do you journey, heroes?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"To the northward do we journey,</l>
        <l>Journey through the foaming billows,</l>
        <l>And above the foam-flecked billows.</l>
        <l>Forth we go to seize the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Gaze upon its pictured cover,</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>

        </lg>

        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>

        <l>Take me with you as your comrade,</l>
        <l>As the third among the heroes,</l>
        <l>When you go to seize the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Bear away the pictured cover.</l>
        <l>Perhaps my manly sword may aid you,</l>
        <l>In the combat may be useful,</l>
        <l>As my hands may bear you witness,</l>
        <l>And my shoulders witness to you."</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Took the man upon his journey,</l>
        <l>In the boat he took the rascal,</l>
        <l>And the lively Lemminkainen</l>

        <l>And he hastened quick to board it,</l>
        <l>And his planks he carried with him</l>
        <l>To the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

        <l>Planks sufficient for the vessel,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>

        <l>Are the sides composed of iron,</l>
        <l>And the prow of steel constructed,</l>

        <head>THE PIKE AND THE KANTELE</head>
        <div type="argument">
        The Sampo-raiders come to a waterfall, beneath which the boat is caught fast on the back of a great pike (1-94). The pike is killed, and the front part is taken into the boat, cooked, and eaten (94-204). Väinämöinen makes the jaws of the pike into a kantele, on which several of the party attempt to play, but without success (205-342).

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

        <l>On beyond the wretched village,</l>
        <l>Singing songs upon the water,</l>
        <l>Joyous songs upon the billows.</l>

        <l>Onward steered old Väinämöinen,</l>

        <l>Through the stones in river standing,</l>

        <l>That the boat its track may follow,</l>

        <l>So that men the least instructed,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Steered the vessel swiftly forward,</l>
        <l>Through the river-rocks he steered it,</l>
        <l>Steered it through the foaming waters,</l>
        <l>And the wooden vessel wedged not,</l>
        <l>Nor the wise man's boat was grounded.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But as they their voyage continued</l>
        <l>Once again in open water,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>Suddenly the vessel halted,</l>
        <l>Stopped the boat upon its journey,</l>
        <l>In its place remained it fastened,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>With the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Pushed into the lake the rudder,</l>
        <l>In the waves the spar of pinewood,</l>
        <l>And they tried to loose the vessel,</l>
        <l>And to free the wooden vessel,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>But they could not move the vessel,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
        <l>Stoop thou down, and look around thee.</l>
        <l>Look what stops the boat from moving,</l>
        <l>Look what keeps the vessel moveless</l>
        <l>Here amid the open water;</l>
        <l>What the force beneath that holds it,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>

        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Stooped him down to look about him,</l>
        <l>And he looked beneath the vessel,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Not on rock the boat is resting,</l>
        <l>Not on boat, and not on branches,</l>
        <l>But upon a pike's broad shoulders,</l>
        <l>And on water-dog's great backbone."</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"All things may be found in rivers,</l>
        <l>Whether they are pikes or branches.</l>
        <l>If we rest on pike's broad shoulders,</l>
        <l>And on water-dog's great backbone,</l>
        <l>Plunge your sword into the water,</l>
        <l>Thus in twain the fish to sever.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Ruddy youth, accomplished rascal,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>Drew his sword from out his sword-belt,</l>
        <l>From his side the bone-destroyer,</l>
        <l>In the lake his sword plunged deeply,</l>
        <l>Thrust it underneath the vessel,</l>
        <l>But he splashed into the water,</l>
        <l>Plunged his hands into the billows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>By the hair seized fast the hero,</l>
        <l>Dragged from out the lake the hero,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>"All pretend to grow to manhood,</l>
        <l>And are ready to be bearded,</l>
        <l>Such as these we count by hundreds,</l>
        <l>And their number mounts to thousands.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From his belt he drew his sword-blade,</l>
        <l>From the sheath the keen-edged weapon,</l>
        <l>And he struck the fish with fury,</l>
        <l>Striking down beneath the vessel,</l>
        <l>But the sword in pieces shivered,</l>
        <l>And the pike was injured nothing.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Not the half of manhood have you,</l>
        <l>Not the third part of a hero,</l>
        <l>But a man is now required,</l>
        <l>And a man's sense now is needed,</l>
        <l>All the sense of the unskilful,</l>
        <l>All the efforts of the others.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then himself he drew his sword-blade,</l>
        <l>Firmly grasped the keen-edged weapon,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>In the lake his sword then thrust he,</l>
        <l>Underneath the boat he struck it,</l>
        <l>At the pike's great shoulders striking</l>
        <l>At the water-dog's great backbone.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the sword was fixed securely,</l>
        <l>In the fish's jaws fixed firmly;</l>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Presently the fish uplifted,</l>
        <l>Dragged it up from out the water,</l>
        <l>And the pike in twain he severed.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>To the bottom sank the fish-tail,</l>
        <l>In the boat the head he hoisted.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Now again moved on the vessel,</l>
        <l>And the boat-prow now was loosened.</l>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast</l>
        <l>To the shoals steered on the vessel,</l>
        <l>To the shore the boat he guided,</l>
        <l>And he turned and looked about him,</l>
        <l>And the pike's great head examined,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>"Let the eldest of the yeomen,</l>
        <l>Come and cleave the pike to pieces,</l>
        <l>Let him carve it into slices,</l>
        <l>Let him hew the head to pieces.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the boat the men made answer,</l>
        <l>From the boat replied the women,</l>
        <l>"But the captor's hands are finer,</l>
        <l>And the speaker's fingers better.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Drew from out the sheath his knife-blade,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>From his side the cold sharp iron,</l>
        <l>That the pike might be divided,</l>
        <l>And he cut the fish to pieces,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Let the youngest of the maidens,</l>
        <l>Cook the pike that we have captured,</l>
        <l>Let her mince it for our breakfast,</l>
        <l>That on fish we make our dinner.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the maidens set to cooking,</l>
        <l>Ten there were who made the effort,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>And they cooked the pike for eating,</l>
        <l>And they minced it for their breakfast;</l>
        <l>On the reefs the bones they scattered,</l>
        <l>On the rocks they left the fishbones.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Saw the bones where they were lying,</l>
        <l>And he turned to look upon them,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"What might perhaps be fashioned from them,</l>
        <l>From the pike's teeth be constructed,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>From the fragments of the jawbones,</l>
        <l>Were they to the smithy taken,</l>
        <l>To the skilful smith entrusted,</l>
        <l>To the hands of one most skilful?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>"Nothing comes from what is useless,</l>
        <l>Nothing can be made of fishbones,</l>
        <l>By a smith in smithy working,</l>
        <l>Though to skilful smith entrusted,</l>
        <l>To the hands of one most skilful."</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Yet a harp might be constructed</l>
        <l>Even of the bones of fishes,</l>
        <l>If there were a skilful workman,</l>
        <l>Who could from the bones construct it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>As no craftsman there was present,</l>
        <l>And there was no skilful workman</l>
        <l>Who could make a harp of fishbones,</l>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Then began the harp to fashion,</l>
        <l>And himself the work accomplished,</l>
        <l>And he made a harp of pikebones,</l>
        <l>Fit to give unending pleasure.</l>
        <l>Out of what did he construct it?</l>
        <l>Chiefly from the great pike's jawbones,</l>
        <l>Whence obtained he pegs to suit it?</l>
        <l>Of the teeth of pike he made them;</l>
        <l>Out of what were harpstrings fashioned?</l>
        <l>From the hairs of Hiisi's gelding.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Now the instrument was ready,</l>
        <l>And the kantele completed,</l>
        <l>Fashioned from the pike's great jawbones,</l>
        <l>And from fins of fish constructed.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon the youths came forward,</l>
        <l>Forward came the married heroes,</l>
        <l>And the half-grown boys came forward,</l>
        <l>And the little girls came likewise,</l>
        <l>Maidens young, and aged women,</l>
        <l>And the women middle-agèd,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>All advanced the harp to gaze on,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Bade the young folks and the old ones,</l>
        <l>And the people middle-agèd,</l>
        <l>With their fingers play upon it,</l>
        <l>On the instrument of fishbone,</l>
        <l>On the kantele of fishbone.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Played the young and played the aged,</l>
        <l>Likewise played the middle-agèd,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>Played the young, and moved their fingers,</l>
        <l>Tried the old, whose heads were shaking,</l>

        <l>Nor composed a tune when playing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"O ye boys half-witted only,</l>
        <l>And ye maidens, all so stupid,</l>
        <l>And you other wretched people,</l>
        <l>'Tis not thus you play upon it,</l>
        <l>Neither are you skilled musicians.</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>Give me now the harp of fishbone,</l>

        <l>At the tips of my ten fingers.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>In his hands the harp uplifted</l>
        <l>And he drew it nearer to him,</l>
        <l>Held it underneath his fingers,</l>
        <l>And he tried to play upon it,</l>
        <l>And the kantele he twisted,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>But could play no tune upon it,</l>
        <l>Draw no cheerful music from it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"There are none among the youthful,</l>
        <l>Nor among the growing people,</l>
        <l>Nor among the aged people,</l>
        <l>Who can play upon these harpstrings,</l>
        <l>Drawing cheerful music from them.</l>
        <l>Perhaps in Pohjola 'twere better,</l>
        <l>Tunes might perhaps be played upon it,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>Cheerful music played upon it,</l>
        <l>If to Pohjola I took it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So to Pohjola he took it,</l>
        <l>And to Sariola he brought it,</l>
        <l>And the boys they played upon it,</l>
        <l>Boys and girls both played upon it,</l>
        <l>And the married men played on it,</l>
        <l>Likewise all the married women,</l>
        <l>And the Mistress played upon it,</l>
        <l>And they turned the harp and twisted,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>Held it firmly in their fingers,</l>
        <l>At the tips of their ten fingers.</l>
        <l>Thus played all the youths of Pohja,</l>
        <l>People played of every station,</l>
        <l>But no cheerful notes came from it,</l>
        <l>And they played no music on it,</l>
        <l>For the strings were all entangled,</l>
        <l>And the horsehair whined most sadly,</l>
        <l>And the notes were all discordant,</l>
        <l>And the music all was jarring.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>

        <l>In the corner slept a blind man,</l>
        <l>By the stove there lay an old man,</l>
        <l>And beside the stove he wakened.</l>
        <l>From the stove he raised an outcry,</l>
        <l>From his couch he grumbled loudly,</l>
        <l>And he grumbled, and he mumbled,</l>
        <l>"Leave it off, and stop your playing,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>With its tongue the harp made answer,</l>

        Väinämöinen plays on the kantele, and all living things, whether belonging to the air, earth, or water, hasten to the spot to listen (1-168). The hearts of all listeners are so affected by the music that tears fall from their eyes, and Väinämöinen's own eyes shed large drops which fall to the ground and trickle into the water, where they are changed into beautiful blue pearls (169-266).

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

        The heroes arrive at Pohjola, and Väinämöinen announces that he has come to take possession of the Sampo, either with good-will, or by force (1-58). The Mistress of Pohjola refuses to yield it either by consent or by compulsion, and calls together her people to oppose him (59-64). Väinämöinen takes the kantele, begins to play, and lulls to sleep all the people of Pohjola, and goes with his companions to search for the Sampo; they take it from the stone mountain and convey it to the boat (65-164). They sail homewards well satisfied, carrying the Sampo with them (165-308). On the third day the Mistress of Pohjola wakes from her sleep, and when she finds that the Sampo has been carried off, she prepares a thick fog, a strong wind, and other impediments, to oppose the robbers of the Sampo, which reach the vessel, and during the tempest Väinämöinen's kantele falls into the water (309-562).

        <l>And within the hill of copper.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>I myself rejoice in welfare,</l>
        <l>Mistress of the mighty Sampo.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"If you will not share the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Give us half to carry with us,</l>
        <l>Then the Sampo, all entire,</l>
        <l>To our vessel will we carry.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Heard him with the greatest anger,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>Called together all her people,</l>
        <l>Summoned all her youthful swordsmen,</l>
        <l>Bade them all to aim their weapons</l>
        <l>At the head of Väinämöinen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Took the kantele and played it,</l>
        <l>Down he sat and played upon it,</l>
        <l>And began a tune delightful.</l>
        <l>All who listened to his playing</l>
        <l>Heard it with delight and wonder,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>And the men were all delighted,</l>
        <l>And the women's mouths were laughing.</l>
        <l>Tears from heroes' eyes were falling,</l>
        <l>Boys upon the ground were kneeling.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>At the last their strength forsook them,</l>
        <l>And the people all were wearied,</l>
        <l>All the listeners sank in slumber,</l>
        <l>On the ground sank all beholders,</l>
        <l>Slept the old and slept the youthful,</l>
        <l>All at Väinämöinen's playing.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the crafty Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
        <l>Put his hand into his pocket,</l>
        <l>And he drew his purse from out it,</l>
        <l>And sleep-needles took he from it,</l>
        <l>And their eyes he plunged in slumber,</l>
        <l>And their eyelashes crossed tightly,</l>
        <l>Locked their eyelids close together,</l>
        <l>Sank the people all in slumber.</l>
        <l>Into sleep he plunged the heroes,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>And they sank in lasting slumber,</l>
        <l>And he plunged in lasting slumber</l>
        <l>All the host of Pohja's people,</l>
        <l>All the people of the village.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he went to fetch the Sampo,</l>
        <l>And behold its pictured cover,</l>
        <l>There in Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
        <l>And within the hill of copper.</l>
        <l>Nine the locks that there secured it,</l>
        <l>Bars secured it, ten in number.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Gently set himself to singing</l>
        <l>At the copper mountain's entrance,</l>
        <l>There beside the stony fortress,</l>
        <l>And the castle doors were shaken,</l>
        <l>And the iron hinges trembled.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Aided by the other heroes,</l>
        <l>Overspread the locks with butter,</l>
        <l>And with bacon rubbed the hinges,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>That the doors should make no jarring,</l>
        <l>And the hinges make no creaking.</l>
        <l>Then the locks he turned with fingers,</l>
        <l>And the bars and bolts he lifted,</l>
        <l>And he broke the locks to pieces,</l>
        <l>And the mighty doors were opened.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
        <l>Of my friends the most illustrious,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>Come thou here to take the Sampo,</l>
        <l>And to seize the pictured cover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Always eager, though unbidden,</l>
        <l>Ready, though men did not praise him,</l>
        <l>Came to carry off the Sampo,</l>
        <l>And to seize the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>And he said as he was coming,</l>
        <l>Boasted as he hastened forward,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>"O, I am a man of mettle,</l>
        <l>And a hero-son of Ukko!</l>
        <l>I can surely move the Sampo,</l>
        <l>And can seize its pictured cover,</l>
        <l>Standing on my right foot only,</l>
        <l>If I touch it with my shoe-heel.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lemminkainen pushed against it,</l>
        <l>Turned himself, and pushed against it,</l>
        <l>Pushed his arms and breast against it,</l>
        <l>On the ground his knees down-pressing,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>But he could not move the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Could not stir the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>For the roots were rooted firmly</l>
        <l>In the depths nine fathoms under.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>There was then a bull in Pohja,</l>
        <l>Which had grown to size enormous,</l>
        <l>And his sides were sleek and fattened,</l>
        <l>And his sinews of the strongest;</l>
        <l>Horns he had in length a fathom,</l>
        <l>One-half more his muzzle's thickness.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So they led him from the meadow,</l>
        <l>On the borders of the ploughed field,</l>
        <l>Up they ploughed the roots of Sampo,</l>
        <l>Those which fixed the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>Then began to move the Sampo,</l>
        <l>And to sway the pictured cover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Secondly, smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Third, the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Carried forth the mighty Sampo,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Forth from Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
        <l>From within the hill of copper,</l>
        <l>To the boat away they bore it,</l>
        <l>And within the ship they stowed it.</l>
        <l>In the boat they stowed the Sampo,</l>
        <l>In the hold the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>Pushed the boat into the water,</l>
        <l>In the waves the hundred-boarded;</l>
        <l>Splashed the boat into the water,</l>
        <l>In the waves its sides descended.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Asked the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Whither shall we bear the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Whither now shall we convey it,</l>
        <l>Take it from this evil country,</l>
        <l>From the wretched land of Pohja?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Thither will we bear the Sampo,</l>
        <l>And will take the pictured cover,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>To the misty island's headland,</l>
        <l>At the end of shady island,</l>
        <l>There in safety can we keep it,</l>
        <l>There it can remain for ever.</l>
        <l>There's a little spot remaining,</l>
        <l>Yet a little plot left over,</l>
        <l>Where they eat not and they fight not,</l>
        <l>Whither swordsmen never wander.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Steered away from Pohja's borders,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>Sailed away in great contentment,</l>
        <l>Joyous to his native country,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Speed from Pohjola, O vessel,</l>
        <l>Make thy way directly homeward,</l>
        <l>Leave behind the foreign country.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Blow, thou wind, and sway the vessel,</l>
        <l>Urge the boat upon the water,</l>
        <l>Lend assistance to the rowers,</l>
        <l>To the rudder give thou lightness,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>On the wide expanse of water,</l>
        <l>Out upon the open water.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"If the oars should be too little,</l>
        <l>And too weak should be the oarsmen,</l>
        <l>In the stern too small the steerer,</l>
        <l>And the vessel's master's children,</l>
        <l>Ahto, give thyself thy oars,</l>
        <l>To the boat, O Water-Master,</l>
        <l>Give the best and newest oars,</l>
        <l>Give us, too, a stronger rudder.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>Do thou seat thee at the oars,</l>
        <l>Do thou undertake the rowing,</l>
        <l>Speed thou on this wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Urge the iron-rowlocked forward,</l>
        <l>Drive it through the foaming billows,</l>
        <l>Through the foam-capped billows drive it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Steered the vessel swiftly forward,</l>
        <l>While the smith named Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>And the lively Lemminkainen,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Set themselves to work the oars,</l>
        <l>And they rowed, and speeded onward</l>
        <l>O'er the sparkling water's surface,</l>
        <l>O'er the surface of the billows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"Formerly when I was rowing,</l>
        <l>There was water for the rowers,</l>
        <l>There was singing for the minstrels,</l>
        <l>But at present time, when rowing,</l>
        <l>Nothing do we hear of singing,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>In the boat we hear no singing,</l>
        <l>On the waves we hear no chanting.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Do not sing upon the waters,</l>
        <l>Do not chant upon the billows;</l>
        <l>Singing brings the boat to halting,</l>
        <l>Songs would but impede the rowing,</l>
        <l>Then would wane the golden daylight,</l>
        <l>And the night descend upon us,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>On the wide expanse of water,</l>
        <l>On the surface of the billows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Anyway, the time is passing,</l>
        <l>Fades away the lovely daylight,</l>
        <l>And the night is swift approaching,</l>
        <l>And the twilight comes upon us,</l>
        <l>Though no song our life enlivens,</l>
        <l>Nor the time is given to chanting."</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Steered the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>O'er the blue lake's shining water,</l>
        <l>And he steered one day, a second,</l>
        <l>And at length upon the third day.</l>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>For a second time inquired,</l>
        <l>"Wherefore sing not, Väinämöinen?</l>
        <l>O thou great one, sing unto us!</l>
        <l>We have won the splendid Sampo;</l>
        <l>Straight the course that now we follow."</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Gave him a decided answer:</l>
        <l>"'Tis too early yet for singing,</l>
        <l>'Tis too early for rejoicing.</l>
        <l>Soon a time will come for singing,</l>
        <l>Fitting time for our rejoicing,</l>
        <l>When we see our doors before us,</l>
        <l>And we hear our own doors creaking.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"In the stern I'll take position,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>And with all my might will sing there,</l>
        <l>And with all my force will bellow.</l>
        <l>Perhaps indeed I cannot do so,</l>
        <l>Loud enough I cannot bellow:</l>
        <l>If you will not sing unto us,</l>
        <l>Then will I commence the singing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Quickly pursed his mouth for singing,</l>
        <l>And prepared himself to carol,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>And began to sing his carols,</l>
        <l>But his songs were most discordant,</l>
        <l>And his voice it sounded hoarsely,</l>
        <l>And his tones were most discordant.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Sang the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Shouted loudly Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Moved his mouth, his beard was wagging,</l>
        <l>And his chin was likewise shaking.</l>
        <l>Far away was heard his singing,</l>
        <l>Far away across the water,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>In six villages they heard it,</l>
        <l>Over seven the song resounded.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On a stump a crane was sitting,</l>
        <l>On a mound from swamp arising,</l>
        <l>And his toe-bones he was counting,</l>
        <l>And his feet he was uplifting,</l>
        <l>And was terrified extremely</l>
        <l>At the song of Lemminkainen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Left the crane his strange employment,</l>
        <l>With his harsh voice screamed in terror,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>From his perch he flew in terror,</l>
        <l>Over Pohjola in terror,</l>
        <l>And upon his coming thither,</l>
        <l>When he reached the swamp of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Screaming still, and screaming harshly,</l>
        <l>Screaming at his very loudest,</l>
        <l>Waked in Pohjola the people,</l>
        <l>And aroused that evil nation.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Up rose Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
        <l>From her long and heavy slumber,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>And she hastened to the farmyard,</l>
        <l>Ran to where the corn was drying,</l>
        <l>And she looked upon the cattle,</l>
        <l>And the corn in haste examined.</l>
        <l>Nought was missing from the cattle,</l>
        <l>And the corn had not been plundered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the hill of stone she wandered,</l>
        <l>And the copper mountain's entrance,</l>
        <l>And she said as she was coming,</l>
        <l>"Woe to me, this day unhappy,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>For a stranger here has entered,</l>

        <l>And the castle's doors been opened,</l>
        <l>And the iron hinges broken.</l>
        <l>Has the Sampo perhaps been stolen,</l>
        <l>And the whole been taken from us?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Yes, the Sampo had been taken,</l>
        <l>Carried off the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>Forth from Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
        <l>From within the hill of copper,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>Though by ninefold locks protected,</l>
        <l>Though ten bars protected likewise.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Fell into the greatest fury,</l>
        <l>But she felt her strength was failing,</l>
        <l>And her power had all departed,</l>
        <l>So she prayed to the Cloud-Maiden.</l>
        <l>"Maiden of the Clouds, Mist-Maiden,</l>

        <l>With their boat contending ever,</l>
        <l>Falling on the head of Väinö,</l>
        <l>Rushing on Uvantolainen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the Maid of Clouds, Mist-Maiden,</l>
        <l>From the lake a cloud breathed upward,</l>
        <l>Through the air the cloud she scattered,</l>
        <l>And detained old Väinämöinen,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>And for three whole nights she kept him</l>
        <l>Out upon the lake's blue surface,</l>
        <l>And he could not move beyond it,</l>
        <l>Nor could he escape beyond it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When for three nights he had rested</l>
        <l>Out upon the lake's blue surface,</l>
        <l>Spoke the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
        <l>"There's no man, how weak soever,</l>
        <l>Not among the laziest heroes,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>Who by clouds would thus be hindered,</l>
        <l>And by mists would thus be worsted.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>With his sword he clove the water,</l>
        <l>In the lake his sword plunged deeply,</l>
        <l>Mead along his blade was flowing,</l>
        <l>Honey from his sword was dropping.</l>
        <l>Then the fog to heaven ascended,</l>
        <l>And the cloud in air rose upward,</l>
        <l>From the lake the mist ascended,</l>
        <l>And the vapour from the lake-waves,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
        <l>And the lake extended widely,</l>
        <l>Wider spread the whole horizon.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But a little time passed over,</l>
        <l>Short the time that then passed over,</l>
        <l>When they heard a mighty roaring,</l>
        <l>At the red boat's side they heard it,</l>
        <l>And the foam flew wildly upwards,</l>
        <l>Near the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Felt the very greatest terror.</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        <l>From his cheeks the blood departed,</l>
        <l>From his cheeks the ruddy colour;</l>
        <l>O'er his head he drew his felt-cap,</l>
        <l>And above his ears he drew it,</l>
        <l>And his cheeks with care he covered,</l>
        <l>And his eyes he covered better.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Looked into the water round him,</l>
        <l>Cast his gaze beside the vessel,</l>
        <l>And he saw a little wonder.</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
        <l>Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
        <l>By the red boat's side was lifting</l>
        <l>High his head from out the water,</l>
        <l>Raising it from out the billows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Grasped his ears upon the instant,</l>
        <l>By his ears he dragged him upward,</l>
        <l>And he sang aloud, and questioned,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
        <l>Wherefore from the lake uplift thee,</l>
        <l>Wherefore rise above the lake-waves,</l>

        <l>Even Kaleva's own children?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
        <l>Was not pleased with this reception,</l>
        <l>But he was not very frightened,</l>
        <l>And no answer he returned him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Asked again an explanation,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
        <l>And a third time asked him loudly,</l>
        <l>"Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
        <l>Wherefore from the lake uplift thee,</l>
        <l>Wherefore rise above the billows?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
        <l>When for the third time he asked him,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Therefore from the lake I raise me,</l>
        <l>Therefore rise above the billows,</l>
        <l>For that in my mind I purpose</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
        <l>Kaleva's great race to ruin,</l>
        <l>Bear to Pohjola the Sampo.</l>
        <l>In the waves if you will send me,</l>
        <l>And my wretched life concede me,</l>
        <l>Not another time ascending,</l>
        <l>In the sight of men I'll venture.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Cast the wretch into the billows,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
        <l>Nevermore from lake arising,</l>
        <l>Or ascending from the lake-waves,</l>
        <l>Venture forth where men can see thee,</l>
        <l>From this very day henceforward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Therefore from that day thenceforward,</l>
        <l>Never from the lake rose Turso,</l>
        <l>In the sight of men to venture,</l>
        <l>Long as sun and moon are shining,</l>
        <l>Or the pleasant day is dawning,</l>
        <l>And the air is most delightful.</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Once again steered on the vessel.</l>
        <l>But a little time passed over,</l>

        <l>Made the tempests rage around them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the winds arose in fury,</l>
        <l>And the tempests raged around them,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
        <l>And the west wind blew most fiercely,</l>
        <l>From the south-west just as fiercely,</l>
        <l>And the south wind still more fiercely,</l>
        <l>And the east wind whistled loudly,</l>
        <l>Roared the south-east wind tremendous,</l>
        <l>And the north wind howled in fury.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the trees the leaves were scattered,</l>
        <l>And the pine-trees lost their needles,</l>
        <l>And the heather lost its flowerets,</l>
        <l>And the grasses lost their tassels,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
        <l>And the black ooze was uplifted</l>

        <l>Still the winds were wildly blowing,</l>

        <l>And the kantele of fish-fins,</l>
        <l>Joy for Vellamo's attendants,</l>
        <l>And to Ahtola a pleasure.</l>
        <l>Ahto on the waves perceived it,</l>
        <l>On the waves his children saw it,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
        <l>And they took the harp so charming,</l>
        <l>And unto their home conveyed it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>From his eyes wept tears of sadness,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Thus has gone what I constructed,</l>
        <l>And my cherished harp has vanished,</l>
        <l>And is lost my life-long pleasure.</l>
        <l>Never will it happen to me,</l>
        <l>In the course of all my lifetime</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
        <l>To rejoice again in pike-teeth,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Felt the very greatest sadness,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Woe to me, this day unhappy,</l>
        <l>That upon the lake I travel,</l>
        <l>On this wide expanse of water,</l>
        <l>That I tread on wood that's rolling,</l>
        <l>And on planks that shake beneath me.</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
        <l>Now my hair has seen the tempest,</l>
        <l>And my hair begins to shudder,</l>
        <l>And my beard ill days has witnessed,</l>
        <l>Which it saw upon the water,</l>
        <l>Yet have we but seldom witnessed,</l>
        <l>Such a storm as rages round us,</l>
        <l>Witnessed such tremendous breakers,</l>
        <l>Or have seen such foam-capped billows.</l>
        <l>Let the wind be now my refuge,</l>
        <l>And the waves have mercy on me."</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Heard his words, and thus responded:</l>
        <l>"In the boat's no place for weeping,</l>
        <l>Room is none for lamentation,</l>
        <l>Weeping helps not in misfortune,</l>
        <l>Howling, not when days are evil.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And he sang and thus expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Water, now restrain thy children,</l>
        <l>And, O wave, do thou restrain them.</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
        <l>Ahto, do thou calm the billows,</l>

        <l>Nor may overwhelm my boat-ribs.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Rise, O wind, aloft to heaven,</l>
        <l>And among the clouds disport thee,</l>
        <l>To thy race, where thou wast nurtured,</l>
        <l>To thy family and kindred.</l>
        <l>Do not harm this wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>Sink thou not this boat of pinewood.</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
        <l>Rather fell burnt trees in clearings,</l>
        <l>On the slopes o'erthrow the pine-trees.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Come, O eagle, thou from Turja,</l>
        <l>Do thou bring three feathers with thee,</l>
        <l>Three, O eagle, two, O raven,</l>
        <l>To protect this little vessel,</l>
        <l>To protect this bad boat's timbers."</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>He himself enlarged the bulwarks,</l>
        <l>Fixed the timbers in their places,</l>
        <l>And to these fresh boards he added,</l>
        <l>And to fathom-height he raised them,</l>
        <l>Higher than the waves were leaping,</l>
        <l>Nor upon his beard they splashed him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>All his work was now completed,</l>
        <l>And the bulwarks raised protecting,</l>
        <l>Though the winds might blow most fiercely,</l>
        <l>And the waves might beat in fury,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
        <l>And the foam be wildly seething,</l>

        <head>THE FIGHT FOR THE SAMPO</head>
        <div type="argument">
        The Mistress of Pohjola equips a war-vessel and goes in pursuit of the robbers of the Sampo (1-22). When she overtakes them a fight ensues between the forces of Pohjola and Kalevala in which the latter conquer (23-258). Nevertheless the Mistress of Pohjola succeeds in dragging the Sampo from the boat into the lake, where it breaks to pieces (259-266). The larger portions sink in the lake, and form its riches, while the smaller pieces are thrown on shore by the waves, at which Väinämöinen is much pleased (267-304). The Mistress of Pohjola threatens to send all evil upon Kalevala, to which Väinämöinen pays no attention (305-368). The Mistress of Pohjola returns home in great distress, taking with her only a small fragment of the cover of the Sampo (369-384). Väinämöinen carefully collects the fragments of the Sampo on the shore, and plants them, hoping for continuous good fortune (385-434).

        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Called together all her forces,</l>
        <l>Bows delivered to her army,</l>
        <l>And the men with swords provided,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the ship the men she stationed,</l>
        <l>And equipped for war the heroes,</l>

        <l>Like a hanging cloud it waved there,</l>
        <l>Like a cloud in heaven suspended;</l>
        <l>Then upon her voyage she started,</l>
        <l>Sailed away and speeded onward,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>O'er the blue lake steered his vessel,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>From the stern where he was seated:</l>
        <l>"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
        <l>Of my friends the dearest to me,</l>
        <l>Climb thou quickly to the masthead,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>Ruddy youth, accomplished scoundrel,</l>
        <l>Very active, though unbidden,</l>
        <l>Very quick, though never boastful,</l>
        <l>To the masthead then ascended,</l>
        <l>Up aloft among the canvas.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
        <l>East he looked, and looked to westward,</l>
        <l>Looked to north-west and to southward,</l>
        <l>Looked across to Pohja's coast-line,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Clear in front is the horizon,</l>
        <l>Dark behind is the horizon,</l>
        <l>Rises north a cloud, a small one,</l>

        </lg>

        <l>"What you say is surely nonsense,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>

        <l>Look again, and look more sharply.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he looked again more sharply,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Far away I see an island,</l>
        <l>Dimly looming in the distance,</l>
        <l>Aspens covered o'er with falcons,</l>

        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

        <l>For no falcons do you see there,</l>
        <l>And no speckled grouse you see there,</l>

        <l>Look more sharply for the third time.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>For the third time looked around him,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>All the truth at once perceiving,</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Saw misfortune fast approaching.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>On his head was doomsday falling,</l>
        <l>And he pondered and reflected,</l>
        <l>How to act and how to save him,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Still I know a plan of safety,</l>
        <l>Still I see a little marvel.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he took a piece of tinder,</l>
        <l>In his tinder-box he found it,</l>
        <l>And of pitch he took a little,</l>
        <l>And a little piece of tinder,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>And into the lake he threw it,</l>
        <l>O'er his shoulder left he threw it,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Let a reef of this be fashioned,</l>
        <l>And a cliff be fashioned from it,</l>
        <l>Where may run the ship of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Fitted with a hundred rowlocks,</l>
        <l>And may strike in lake tempestuous,</l>
        <l>And amid the waves be shattered."</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon a reef grew upward,</l>
        <l>In the lake a cliff was fashioned,</l>
        <l>Half its length to east directed,</l>
        <l>And its breadth to north directed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Onward sped the ship of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Gliding swiftly through the lake-waves,</l>
        <l>And upon the reef came rushing,</l>
        <l>And upon the rocks wedged firmly.</l>
        <l>Broke across the wooden vessel,</l>
        <l>And to splinters it was broken;</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>In the lake the masts fell crashing,</l>
        <l>And the sails fell drooping downward,</l>
        <l>By the wind away were carried,</l>
        <l>And the spring wind all dispersed them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Plunged her feet into the water,</l>
        <l>And she tried to push the vessel,</l>
        <l>And she tried to raise the vessel,</l>
        <l>But no spear could lift the vessel,</l>
        <l>And she could not even move it,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>For the ribs had all been shattered,</l>
        <l>All the rowlocks had been broken.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And she pondered and reflected,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Who can aid me now with counsel?</l>
        <l>Who can help me in this trouble?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then her form she quickly altered,</l>
        <l>To another shape transformed her,</l>
        <l>And she took five scythes the sharpest,</l>
        <l>And six hoes, worn out completely;</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>These she fashioned into talons,</l>
        <l>Into claws did she convert them;</l>
        <l>Half the broken vessel's fragments</l>
        <l>Did she then arrange beneath her,</l>
        <l>And the sides to wings she fashioned,</l>
        <l>And to tail she turned the rudder,</l>
        <l>'Neath her wings took men a hundred,</l>
        <l>On her tail she took a thousand,</l>
        <l>And the hundred men were swordsmen,</l>
        <l>And the thousand men were archers.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Then she flew, her wings extending,</l>
        <l>And she soared aloft as eagle,</l>
        <l>And she poised herself and hovered,</l>
        <l>To attack old Väinämöinen;</l>
        <l>In the clouds one wing was flapping,</l>
        <l>In the water splashed the other.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the fairest Water-Mother</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Turn thy head beneath the sunrise,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>Do thou turn thine eyes to north-west,</l>
        <l>Look a little now behind thee.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Turned his head beneath the sunrise,</l>
        <l>And he turned his eyes to north-west,</l>
        <l>Looked a little just behind him.</l>
        <l>Onward came the crone of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And the wondrous bird was hovering</l>
        <l>Like a hawk about his shoulders,</l>
        <l>With the body of an eagle.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Soon she came near Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>And she flew upon the masthead,</l>
        <l>Clambered out upon the sailyard,</l>
        <l>And upon the pole she sat her,</l>
        <l>And the boat was nearly sinking,</l>
        <l>And the vessel's side lurched downward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Sought from Jumala assistance,</l>
        <l>And invoking the Creator,</l>
        <l>Then he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>"Save us, O thou good Creator,</l>
        <l>Gracious Jumala, protect us,</l>
        <l>That the son may not be hurried,</l>
        <l>Nor the mother's child hurled downward,</l>
        <l>From among the living creatures,</l>
        <l>From the creatures whom thou rulest.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Ukko, Jumala the Highest,</l>
        <l>Thou our Father in the heavens,</l>
        <l>Cast a fiery robe around me,</l>
        <l>Over me a shirt of fire,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>That I thus may fight protected,</l>
        <l>And may thus contend protected,</l>
        <l>That my head may fear no evil,</l>
        <l>Nor my hair may be disordered,</l>
        <l>When the shining swords are clashing,</l>
        <l>And the steely points are meeting.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Hail, O Pohjola's great Mistress!</l>
        <l>Wilt thou now divide the Sampo,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>Out upon the jutting headland,</l>
        <l>On the misty island's summit?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>"No, I'll not divide the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Not with thee, thou wretched creature,</l>
        <l>Not with thee, O Väinämöinen!"</l>
        <l>And she swooped to snatch the Sampo</l>
        <l>From the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
        <l>Drew his sword from out his swordbelt,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Firm he grasped the sharpened iron,</l>
        <l>And from his left side he drew it,</l>
        <l>Striking at the eagle's talons,</l>
        <l>At the claws of eagle striking.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Struck the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>As he struck, these words he uttered:</l>
        <l>"Down ye men, and down ye swordsmen,</l>
        <l>Down with all the sleepy heroes!</l>
        <l>From her wings, ye men a hundred,</l>
        <l>Ten from ends of every feather."</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered then the crone of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And she answered from the masthead:</l>
        <l>"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
        <l>Wretched Kauko, worthless fellow,</l>
        <l>For thou hast deceived thy mother,</l>
        <l>Lied unto thy aged mother!</l>
        <l>Thou wast pledged to seek no battle</l>
        <l>In the space of sixty summers,</l>
        <l>Whether need of gold should tempt thee,</l>
        <l>Or the love of silver urge thee."</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
        <l>Thought his doom had come upon him,</l>
        <l>And he felt his bane approaching;</l>
        <l>From the lake he drew the rudder,</l>
        <l>Took the oak-spar from the billows,</l>
        <l>And with this he struck the monster,</l>
        <l>On the claws he struck the eagle,</l>
        <l>All the other claws he shattered,</l>
        <l>There remained the smallest only.</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From her wings the youths dropped downward,</l>
        <l>In the lake the men splashed downward,</l>
        <l>From beneath her wings a hundred,</l>
        <l>From her tail a thousand heroes;</l>
        <l>Down there dropped the eagle likewise,</l>
        <l>Crashing down upon the boat-ribs,</l>
        <l>As from tree the capercailzie,</l>
        <l>Or from fir-branch drops the squirrel.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then she tried to seize the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Seized it with her nameless finger,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>From the boat she dragged the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Down she pulled the pictured cover,</l>
        <l>From the red boat's hold she pulled it,</l>
        <l>'Mid the blue lake's waters cast it,</l>
        <l>And the Sampo broke to pieces,</l>
        <l>And was smashed the pictured cover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the fragments all were scattered,</l>
        <l>And the Sampo's larger pieces</l>
        <l>Sank beneath the peaceful waters</l>
        <l>To the black ooze at the bottom;</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>Thence there springs the water's riches,</l>
        <l>And the wealth of Ahto's people.</l>
        <l>Nevermore in all his lifetime,</l>
        <l>While the golden moon is shining,</l>
        <l>Shall the wealth of Ahto fail him,</l>
        <l>Neither shall his watery honours.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Other pieces were remaining,</l>
        <l>Rather small those other fragments,</l>
        <l>On the blue lake's surface floating,</l>
        <l>Tossing on the broad lake's billows,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>And the wind for ever rocked them,</l>
        <l>And the billows drove them onward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the wind still rocked the fragments,</l>
        <l>And the lake-waves ever tossed them,</l>
        <l>On the blue lake's surface floating,</l>
        <l>Tossing on the broad lake's billows;</l>
        <l>To the land the wind impelled them,</l>
        <l>To the shore the billows drove them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>In the surf beheld them floating,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>Through the breakers shoreward driving,</l>
        <l>Then on shore upcast by billows,</l>
        <l>Saw the fragments of the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Splinters of the pictured cover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Very greatly did it please him,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"From these seeds the plant is sprouting,</l>
        <l>Lasting welfare is commencing,</l>
        <l>Here is ploughing, here is sowing,</l>
        <l>Here is every kind of increase,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>

        <l>And the lovely land of Suomi.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
        <l>Speak aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Still can I devise a method,</l>
        <l>Find a method and contrivance,</l>
        <l>'Gainst thy ploughing and thy sowing,</l>

        <l>And will send the Frost to freeze you,</l>
        <l>That the frozen air destroyeth</l>
        <l>What thou ploughest and thou sowest,</l>
        <l>Thy provisions and thy harvests.</l>
        <l>I will send a hail of iron,</l>
        <l>And a hail of steel o'erwhelming,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>Over all thy finest clearings,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>"On the heath the bear I'll waken,</l>
        <l>From the pines the wide-toothed monster,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
        <l>Answer in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>

        <l>By the lake my wealth was taken,</l>

        <l>Then she hastened homeward weeping,</l>
        <l>Back to Pohjola lamenting.</l>
        <l>Nothing worthy to be mentioned</l>
        <l>Of the Sampo brought she homeward,</l>
        <l>Nothing but a little fragment,</l>

        <l>But a fragment of the cover,</l>

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Went back likewise to his country,</l>
        <l>But he took the Sampo's fragments,</l>
        <l>And the fragments of the cover,</l>
        <l>From the lakeshore where he found them,</l>

        <l>Out upon the jutting headland,</l>
        <l>On the misty island's summit,</l>

        <head>VÄINÄMÖINEN'S NEW KANTELE</head>
        <div type="argument">
        Väinämöinen goes to seek for his kantele which was lost in the lake, but cannot find it (1-76). He makes himself a new kantele of birchwood, on which he plays, and delights every creature in the neighbourhood (77-334).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>In his mind was thus reflecting:</l>
        <l>"Now the time has come for music,</l>
        <l>Time to give ourselves to pleasure,</l>
        <l>In our dwelling newly chosen,</l>
        <l>In our homestead now so charming,</l>
        <l>But the kantele is sunken,</l>
        <l>And my joy has gone for ever</l>
        <l>To the dwelling-place of fishes,</l>
        <l>To the rock-caves of the salmon,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>Where it may enchant the lake-pike,</l>
        <l>Likewise Vellamo's attendants;</l>
        <l>But they never will return it,</l>
        <l>Ahto will no more return it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Yestreen and before thou workedst,</l>
        <l>Work to-day with equal vigour.</l>
        <l>Forge me now a rake of iron,</l>
        <l>Let the teeth be close together,</l>
        <l>Close the teeth, and long the handle</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>That I rake among the billows,</l>
        <l>And may rake the waves together,</l>
        <l>And may rake among the lake-reeds,</l>
        <l>With the rake rake all the margins,</l>
        <l>And my instrument recover,</l>
        <l>And the kantele recover,</l>
        <l>From the devious paths of fishes,</l>
        <l>From the rocky caves of salmon.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        <l>Forged for him a rake of iron,</l>
        <l>Furnished with a copper handle,</l>
        <l>Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,</l>
        <l>And the handle full five hundred.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Took the mighty rake of iron,</l>
        <l>And a little way he wandered,</l>
        <l>Made a very little journey,</l>
        <l>Till he reached the quay, steel-fitted,</l>
        <l>And the landing-stage of copper.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
        <l>There he found a boat, found two boats,</l>
        <l>Both the boats were waiting ready</l>
        <l>On the quay, with steel all fitted,</l>
        <l>On the landing-stage of copper,</l>
        <l>And the first boat was a new one,</l>
        <l>And the second was an old one.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>To the new boat firstly speaking:</l>
        <l>"Go, thou boat, into the water,</l>
        <l>To the waves, O vessel, rush thou,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>Even though no arm should turn thee,</l>
        <l>Even though no thumbs should touch thee.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Sped the boat into the water,</l>
        <l>Rushed amid the waves the vessel.</l>
        <l>Old and steadfast Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>In the stern made haste to seat him,</l>
        <l>And he went to sweep the water,</l>
        <l>And to sweep among the billows.</l>
        <l>Scattered leaves of water-lilies,</l>
        <l>Raked he up among the shore-drift,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>All the rubbish raked together,</l>
        <l>All the rubbish, bits of rushes,</l>
        <l>Every scrap he raked together,</l>
        <l>All the shoals with care raked over,</l>
        <l>But he found not, nor discovered,</l>
        <l>Where his pike-bone harp was hidden,</l>
        <l>And this joy was gone for ever,</l>
        <l>With the kantele was sunken.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Then returned unto his dwelling,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>Head bowed down, and sadly grieving,</l>
        <l>And his cap awry adjusted,</l>
        <l>And he said the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Unto me is lost for ever</l>
        <l>Pleasure from the harp of pike-teeth,</l>
        <l>From the harp I made of fish-bone.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>As he wandered through the country,</l>
        <l>On the borders of the woodlands,</l>
        <l>There he heard a birch-tree weeping,</l>
        <l>And a speckled tree lamenting,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>And in that direction hastened,</l>
        <l>Walking till he reached the birch-tree.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon he spoke and asked it,</l>
        <l>"Wherefore weep'st thou, beauteous birch-tree,</l>
        <l>Shedding tears, O green-leaved birch-tree,</l>
        <l>By thy belt of white conspicuous?</l>
        <l>To the war thou art not taken,</l>
        <l>Longest not for battle-struggle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answer made the leaning birch-tree,</l>
        <l>And the green-leaved tree responded:</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>"There is much that I could speak of,</l>
        <l>Many things I might reflect on,</l>
        <l>How I best might live in pleasure,</l>
        <l>And I might rejoice for pleasure.</l>
        <l>I am wretched in my sorrow,</l>
        <l>And can but rejoice in trouble,</l>
        <l>Living with my life o'erclouded,</l>
        <l>And lamenting in my sorrow.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"And I weep my utter weakness,</l>
        <l>And my worthlessness lament for,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>I am poor, and all unaided,</l>
        <l>Wholly wretched, void of succour,</l>
        <l>Here in such an evil station,</l>
        <l>On a plain among the willows.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>"Perfect happiness and pleasure</l>
        <l>Others always are expecting,</l>
        <l>When arrives the beauteous summer,</l>
        <l>In the warm days of the summer.</l>
        <l>But my fate is different, wretched,</l>
        <l>Nought but wretchedness awaits me;</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>And my bark is peeling from me,</l>
        <l>Down are hewed my leafy branches.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>"Often unto me defenceless</l>
        <l>Oft to me, unhappy creature,</l>
        <l>In the short spring come the children,</l>
        <l>Quickly to the spot they hurry,</l>
        <l>And with sharpened knives they score me,</l>
        <l>Draw my sap from out my body,</l>
        <l>And in summer wicked herdsmen,</l>
        <l>Strip from me my white bark-girdle,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>Cups and plates therefrom constructing,</l>

        <l>From my crown they cut the branches,</l>
        <l>And they bind them into besoms.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Often too, am I, defenceless,</l>
        <l>Oft am I, unhappy creature,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>Hewed away to make a clearing,</l>
        <l>Cut to pieces into faggots.</l>
        <l>Thrice already in this summer,</l>
        <l>In the warm days of the summer,</l>
        <l>Unto me have come the woodmen,</l>
        <l>And have hewed me with their axes,</l>
        <l>Hewed the crown from me unhappy,</l>
        <l>And my weak life has departed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"This has been my joy in summer,</l>
        <l>In the warm days of the summer,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>But no better was the winter,</l>
        <l>Nor the time of snow more pleasant.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"And in former times already,</l>
        <l>Has my face been changed by trouble,</l>
        <l>And my head has drooped with sadness,</l>
        <l>And my cheeks have paled with sorrow,</l>
        <l>Thinking o'er the days of evil,</l>
        <l>Pondering o'er the times of evil.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"And the wind brought ills upon me,</l>
        <l>And the frost brought bitter sorrows.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>Tore the wind my green cloak from me,</l>
        <l>Frost my pretty dress from off me.</l>
        <l>Thus am I of all the poorest,</l>
        <l>And a most unhappy birch-tree,</l>
        <l>Standing stripped of all my clothing,</l>
        <l>As a naked trunk I stand here,</l>
        <l>And in cold I shake and tremble,</l>
        <l>And in frost I stand lamenting.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"Weep no more, O verdant birch-tree!</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Leafy sapling, weep no longer,</l>
        <l>Thou, equipped with whitest girdle,</l>
        <l>For a pleasant future waits thee,</l>
        <l>New and charming joys await thee.</l>
        <l>Soon shalt thou with joy be weeping,</l>
        <l>Shortly shalt thou sing for pleasure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Carved into a harp the birch-tree,</l>
        <l>On a summer day he carved it,</l>
        <l>To a kantele he shaped it,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>At the end of cloudy headland,</l>
        <l>And upon the shady island,</l>
        <l>And the harp-frame he constructed,</l>
        <l>From the trunk he formed new pleasure,</l>
        <l>And the frame of toughest birchwood;</l>
        <l>From the mottled trunk he formed it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>In the very words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Now the frame I have constructed,</l>
        <l>From the trunk for lasting pleasure.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>Whence shall now the screws be fashioned,</l>
        <l>Whence shall come the pegs to suit me?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the yard there grew an oak-tree,</l>
        <l>By the farmyard it was standing,</l>
        <l>'Twas an oak with equal branches,</l>
        <l>And on every branch an acorn,</l>
        <l>In the acorns golden kernels,</l>
        <l>On each kernel sat a cuckoo.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When the cuckoos all were calling,</l>
        <l>In the call five tones were sounding,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>Gold from out their mouths was flowing,</l>
        <l>Silver too they scattered round them,</l>
        <l>On a hill the gold was flowing,</l>
        <l>On the ground there flowed the silver,</l>
        <l>And from this he made the harp-screws,</l>
        <l>And the pegs from that provided.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>In the very words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Now the harp-screws are constructed,</l>
        <l>And the harp-pegs are provided.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>Something even now is wanting,</l>
        <l>And five strings as yet are needed.</l>
        <l>How shall I provide the harp-strings,</l>
        <l>Which shall yield the notes in playing?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he went to seek for harp-strings,</l>
        <l>And along the heath he wandered.</l>
        <l>On the heath there sat a maiden,</l>
        <l>Sat a damsel in the valley,</l>
        <l>And the maiden was not weeping,</l>
        <l>Neither was she very joyful.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>To herself she sang full softly,</l>
        <l>Sang, that soon might come the evening,</l>
        <l>Hoping for her lover's coming,</l>
        <l>For the dear one she had chosen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Crept without his shoes towards her,</l>
        <l>Sprang to her without his stockings,</l>
        <l>And as soon as he approached her,</l>
        <l>He besought her hair to give him,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>"Give thy hair to me, O maiden,</l>
        <l>Give me of thy hair, O fair one,</l>
        <l>Give me hair to form my harp-strings,</l>
        <l>For the tones of lasting pleasure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then her hair the maiden gave him,</l>
        <l>From her soft locks hair she gave him,</l>
        <l>And she gave him five and six hairs,</l>
        <l>Seven the hairs she gave unto him,</l>
        <l>That he thus might form his harp-strings,</l>
        <l>For the tones of lasting pleasure.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Now the harp at last was finished,</l>
        <l>And the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>On a rock his seat selected,</l>
        <l>Near the steps, upon a stone bench.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In his hands the harp then taking,</l>
        <l>Very near he felt his pleasure,</l>
        <l>And the frame he turned to heaven,</l>
        <l>On his knees the knob then propping,</l>
        <l>All the strings he put in order,</l>
        <l>Fit to make melodious music.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>When he had the strings adjusted,</l>
        <l>Then the instrument was ready;</l>
        <l>Underneath his hands he placed it,</l>
        <l>And across his knees he laid it,</l>
        <l>With his ten nails did he play it,</l>
        <l>And he let five active fingers</l>
        <l>Draw the tunes from out the harp-strings,</l>
        <l>Making most delightful music.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Thus upon his harp was playing,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>Fine his hands, his fingers tender,</l>
        <l>And his fingers curving outwards,</l>
        <l>Then rang out the wood so speckled,</l>
        <l>Sang the sapling green full loudly,</l>
        <l>Loudly called the golden cuckoo,</l>
        <l>And rejoiced the hair of maiden.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus played Väinämöinen's fingers,</l>
        <l>And the harp-strings loud resounded,</l>
        <l>Mountains shook and plains resounded,</l>
        <l>All the rocky hills resounded,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>In the waves the stones were rocking,</l>

        <l>On the heath the stumps were skipping.</l>

        <l>As they heard the music playing,</l>

        <l>Likewise many men were present,</l>

        <l>When the brilliant moon was shining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Far was heard the charming music,</l>
        <l>In six villages they heard it,</l>
        <l>There was not a single creature</l>
        <l>But it hurried forth to listen,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>And to hear the charming music</l>
        <l>From the kantele resounding.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>All the wild beasts of the forest</l>
        <l>Upright on their claws were resting</l>
        <l>To the kantele to listen,</l>
        <l>And they wondered at their pleasure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>All the birds in air then flying,</l>
        <l>Perched upon the neighbouring branches,</l>
        <l>All the fish that swam the waters,</l>
        <l>To the margin hastened quickly,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>And the worms in earth then creeping,</l>
        <l>Up above the ground then hastened,</l>
        <l>And they turned themselves and listened,</l>
        <l>Listened to the charming music,</l>
        <l>In the kantele rejoicing,</l>
        <l>And in Väinämöinen's singing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Played in his most charming manner,</l>
        <l>Most melodiously resounding;</l>
        <l>And he played one day, a second,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>Playing on, without cessation,</l>
        <l>Every morning after breakfast,</l>
        <l>Girded with the selfsame girdle,</l>
        <l>And the same shirt always wearing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When he in his house was playing,</l>
        <l>In his house of fir constructed,</l>
        <l>All the roofs resounded loudly,</l>
        <l>And the boards resounded likewise,</l>
        <l>Ceilings sang, the doors were creaking,</l>
        <l>All the windows were rejoicing,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>And the hearthstones all were moving,</l>
        <l>Birchwood columns sang in answer.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When he walked among the pinewoods,</l>
        <l>And he wandered through the firwoods,</l>
        <l>All the pines bowed down before him,</l>
        <l>To the very ground the fir-trees;</l>
        <l>On the grass the cones rolled round him,</l>
        <l>On the roots the needles scattered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When he hurried through the greenwood,</l>
        <l>Or across the heath was hastening,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>All the leaves called gaily to him,</l>
        <l>And the heath was all rejoicing,</l>
        <l>And the flowers breathed fragrance round him,</l>
        <l>And the young shoots bowed before him.</l>

        <head>THE PESTILENCE IN KALEVALA</head>
        <div type="argument">
        The Mistress of Pohjola sends terrible diseases to Kalevala (1-190). Väinämöinen heals the people by powerful incantations and unguents (191-362).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>In her ears received the tidings</l>
        <l>That in Väinölä it prospered,</l>
        <l>And that Kalevala had flourished,</l>
        <l>Through the fragments of the Sampo,</l>
        <l>Fragments of the pictured cover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon she grew most envious,</l>
        <l>And for evermore reflected</l>
        <l>On the death that she might fashion,</l>
        <l>How she best might bring destruction</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>On the people in Väinölä,</l>
        <l>And on Kalevala's whole people.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then she prayed aloud to Ukko,</l>
        <l>And she thus implored the Thunderer:</l>
        <l>"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>Slay thou Kaleva's whole people,</l>
        <l>Slay them with thy hail of iron,</l>
        <l>With thy steely needles slay them,</l>
        <l>Or by sickness let them perish,</l>
        <l>Let the evil nation perish,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>Let the men die in the farmyard,</l>
        <l>On the cowshed floor the women.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Lived in Tuonela a blind maid,</l>
        <l>Loviatar, an aged woman,</l>
        <l>She the worst of Tuoni's daughters,</l>
        <l>And of Mana's maids most hideous,</l>
        <l>She, the source of every evil,</l>
        <l>Origin of woes a thousand,</l>
        <l>With a face of perfect blackness,</l>
        <l>And a skin of hue most hideous.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then this daughter black of Tuoni,</l>
        <l>Ulappala's blind-eyed damsel,</l>
        <l>Made her bed upon the pathway,</l>
        <l>On the straw in evil country,</l>
        <l>And her back she turned to windward,</l>
        <l>Sideways to the bitter weather,</l>
        <l>Backwards to the blast so freezing,</l>
        <l>And the chilling winds of morning.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then a great wind rose in fury,</l>
        <l>From the east a mighty tempest,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
        <l>Blew this wretched creature pregnant,</l>
        <l>And she quickened from the tempest,</l>
        <l>On a barren waste all treeless,</l>
        <l>On the bare and grassless meadows.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And she bore a heavy burden,</l>
        <l>Bore a heavy painful burden,</l>
        <l>Bore it two months, bore it three months,</l>
        <l>And for four and five months bore it,</l>
        <l>Bore it seven months, bore it eight months,</l>
        <l>For the ninth month also bore it,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>As old wives are wont to reckon,</l>
        <l>And for half the tenth month likewise.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>When the ninth month had passed over,</l>
        <l>And the tenth month was beginning,</l>
        <l>Then she writhed about in anguish,</l>
        <l>And the greatest pain oppressed her,</l>
        <l>But as yet she brought forth nothing,</l>
        <l>And no brood as yet resulted.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From her lair at length she moved her,</l>
        <l>In another place she laid her,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>And the wench in childbed laid her,</l>
        <l>Sport of winds, in hopes of children.</l>
        <l>There betwixt two rocks she laid her,</l>
        <l>In the clefts among five mountains,</l>
        <l>But as yet she brought forth nothing,</l>
        <l>And no brood as yet resulted.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And she sought a place for breeding,</l>
        <l>Sought a place for bearing suited,</l>
        <l>In the quaking swamps she sought it,</l>
        <l>And among the waves she sought it,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>But she found no place to suit her,</l>
        <l>Where she could relieve her burden.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then she fain would bring forth children,</l>
        <l>And relieve her body's burden</l>
        <l>In the foam of furious cataract,</l>
        <l>'Neath where whirl the furious waters,</l>
        <l>Where three waterfalls are falling,</l>
        <l>Under nine of precipices,</l>
        <l>But as yet she brought forth nothing,</l>
        <l>Nor the foul one eased her burden.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>Then began to weep, the foul one,</l>
        <l>And to howl, the wicked monster.</l>
        <l>Whither now to go she knew not,</l>
        <l>And in what direction wander,</l>
        <l>Where she might relieve her burden,</l>
        <l>Where to go to cast her offspring.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the clouds then bespoke her Jumala,</l>
        <l>The Creator spoke from heaven:</l>
        <l>"Stands in swamp a hut three-cornered,</l>
        <l>Just upon a lakelet's margin,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>In the gloomy land of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Near where Sariola's bay stretches.</l>
        <l>There thou may'st bring forth thy offspring,</l>
        <l>There lay down thy heavy burden,</l>
        <l>There it is that people need thee,</l>
        <l>There do they expect thy offspring.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Therefore Tuoni's blackest daughter,</l>
        <l>Manala's most hideous damsel,</l>
        <l>Came unto the house of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Came to Sariola's great bathroom,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>That she there might bear her children,</l>
        <l>And she might bring forth her offspring.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Secret led her to the bathroom,</l>
        <l>Secretly into the bathroom,</l>
        <l>But the village did not know it,</l>
        <l>Nought was spoken in the village.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Secretly she warmed the bathroom,</l>
        <l>Hastily she made it ready,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>And with ale the doors smeared over,</l>
        <l>And with beer the hinges wetted,</l>
        <l>That the doors should make no jarring,</l>
        <l>And the hinges make no creaking.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then she spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And expressed herself in thiswise:</l>
        <l>"Noble dame, Creation's daughter,</l>
        <l>Noble one, as gold all lustrous,</l>
        <l>Thou the oldest of all women,</l>
        <l>Thou the first of all the mothers,</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>Knee-deep in the lake descend thou,</l>
        <l>To thy waist among the billows,</l>
        <l>From the perch the slime obtain thou,</l>
        <l>And the slime from creeping creatures,</l>
        <l>Do thou smear with this the gateway,</l>
        <l>And upon the sides anoint it,</l>
        <l>Free the damsel from her burden,</l>
        <l>And the woman from her sufferings,</l>
        <l>Free her from this grievous torment,</l>
        <l>And release her from her sufferings.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"But if this is not sufficient,</l>
        <l>Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>Hither come where thou art needed,</l>
        <l>Come thou at our supplication.</l>
        <l>Here there is a girl in childbed,</l>
        <l>And a woman suffering greatly,</l>
        <l>Here amid the bathroom's vapour,</l>
        <l>Brought into the village bathroom.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Do thou take thy club all golden,</l>
        <l>In thy right hand do thou take it,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>Each impediment remove thou,</l>
        <l>And the door-posts move asunder,</l>
        <l>Bend thou the Creator's castles,</l>
        <l>Break thou all the bars asunder,</l>
        <l>Push the large ones and the small ones,</l>
        <l>Even to the very smallest.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then this foul and wicked creature,</l>
        <l>She, the daughter blind of Tuoni,</l>
        <l>Presently relieved her burden,</l>
        <l>And she brought forth evil children,</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>'Neath a rug adorned with copper,</l>
        <l>Underneath the softest blankets.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus became she nine sons' mother,</l>
        <l>In a single night of summer,</l>
        <l>With the bath prepared once only,</l>
        <l>With the bath but once made ready,</l>

        <l>From the fulness of her body.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the boys their names assigned she,</l>
        <l>And she nurtured well the children</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Just as each one names the children</l>
        <l>Whom themselves have brought to being.</l>
        <l>One as Pleurisy she destined,</l>
        <l>One did she send forth as Colic,</l>
        <l>And as Gout she reared another,</l>
        <l>One as Scrofula she fashioned,</l>
        <l>Boil, another designated,</l>
        <l>And as Itch proclaimed another,</l>
        <l>Thrust another forth as Cancer,</l>
        <l>And as Plague she formed another.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>One remained, and he was nameless,</l>
        <l>In the straw the lowest lying,</l>
        <l>Therefore did she send him onward,</l>
        <l>As a sorcerer on the waters,</l>
        <l>Also to bewitch the lowlands,</l>
        <l>Everywhere to practise malice.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Sent the others forth to journey</l>
        <l>To the cloud-encompassed headland,</l>
        <l>And the shady island's summit,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>Sent in rage these evil monsters,</l>
        <l>These diseases all unheard of,</l>
        <l>Forth to Väinölä she sent them,</l>
        <l>Kaleva's great race to slaughter.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Sickened Väinölä's own people,</l>
        <l>Kaleva's descendants sickened,</l>
        <l>With diseases all unheard of,</l>
        <l>And whose names were known to no one,</l>
        <l>And the floors beneath them rotted,</l>
        <l>And the sheet above corrupted.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
        <l>Went to drive away the evil,</l>

        <l>And against disease to struggle.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon he warmed the bathroom,</l>
        <l>And the stones prepared to heat it,</l>
        <l>And the finest wood provided,</l>
        <l>Faggots, too, he laid in water;</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>Water brought in covered vessels,</l>

        <l>Then he raised a warmth like honey,</l>

        The Mistress of Pohjola sends a bear to destroy the herds of Kalevala (1-20). Väinämöinen kills the bear, and a great feast is held in Kalevala in honour of the occasion (21-606). Väinämöinen sings, plays on the kantele, and hopes that a time of great happiness and prosperity is coming to Kalevala (607-644).

        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Thereupon again grew furious,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>"Still I know another method,</l>
        <l>And a cunning scheme have thought on.</l>
        <l>On the heath the Bear I'll waken,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>On the heath the bear she wakened,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the smith a spear constructed,</l>
        <l>Not a long one, not a short one,</l>
        <l>But of middle length he forged it.</l>
        <l>On the blade a wolf was sitting,</l>
        <l>On the edge a bear was standing,</l>
        <l>At the joint an elk was trotting,</l>
        <l>On the shaft a colt was running,</l>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Heard his dog was barking loudly,</l>

        <l>Just beside the Small-eye's dwelling,</l>
        <l>In the pathway of the Broad-nose;</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"First I thought it was a cuckoo,</l>
        <l>Thought I heard a love-bird singing,</l>
        <l>But no cuckoo there is calling,</l>
        <l>And no love-bird there is singing,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>But it is my dog that's baying,</l>

        <l>Morning, at the door of storehouse,</l>
        <l>At the gate a week I waited,</l>
        <l>And a month at pathway's opening.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>In the lane I stayed a winter,</l>
        <l>Stood in snow while ground was hardened,</l>
        <l>Till the hardened land grew softer,</l>
        <l>And the soft ground turned to gravel,</l>
        <l>And to sand was changed the gravel,</l>
        <l>And the sand at length grew verdant,</l>
        <l>And I pondered every morning,</l>
        <l>In my head reflected daily,</l>
        <l>'Wherefore is the Bear delaying?</l>
        <l>Why delays the forest's darling?</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>

        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Where's my guest to be conducted,</l>
        <l>Whither shall I lead my gold one?</l>
        <l>To the barn shall I conduct him</l>
        <l>On a bed of straw to lay him?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the people gave him answer,</l>
        <l>Shouted all the handsome people,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>"Better lead our guest illustrious,</l>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>

        <l>O my charge, with paws of honey,</l>
        <l>Still there's ground for thee to walk on,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Now be careful, luckless woman,</l>
        <l>That the herd may not be frightened,</l>

        <l>Nor the mistress' calves be frightened,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>If the bear approach the homestead,</l>
        <l>And his shaggy jaws should seize them.</l>

        <l>"Now, ye boys, the porch abandon,</l>
        <l>Girls, depart ye from the door-posts,</l>
        <l>To the house there comes the hero,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Otso, apple of the forest,</l>
        <l>Fair and bulky forest dweller,</l>
        <l>Be not frightened at the maidens,</l>
        <l>Fear not the unbraided maidens,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"Jumala be gracious to us,</l>
        <l>Underneath these famous rafters,</l>

        <l>Whither shall I take my darling,</l>
        <l>And shall bring the shaggy creature?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the people spoke in answer,</l>
        <l>"Hail, all hail to thee who comest!</l>
        <l>Thither shalt thou bring thy birdling,</l>
        <l>Thither take thy golden beauty</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Be not grieved for this, O Otso,</l>

        <l>For thy hide will not be injured,</l>
        <l>And thy hair will not be draggled,</l>
        <l>Like the rags of evil people,</l>
        <l>Or the clothing of the beggars.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>From the bear stripped off the bearskin,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>On the storehouse floor he laid it,</l>

        <l>With the meat he overfilled them,</l>
        <l>Salt unto the stew he added,</l>
        <l>Brought from very distant regions,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When the meat enough was sodden,</l>
        <l>From the fire they took the kettles,</l>
        <l>And the booty then was carried,</l>
        <l>And the crossbill then they carried</l>
        <l>Quickly to the long deal table,</l>
        <l>In the golden dishes laid it,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Comrade old, with golden bosom,</l>

        <l>Thou of Metsola sweet matron,</l>

        <l>Handsome man, the son of Tapio,</l>
        <l>Handsome red-capped son of Tapio;</l>

        <l>Here there is enough for storage,</l>
        <l>Plenty too, to give the village.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the people then responded,</l>
        <l>Answered thus the handsome people:</l>
        <l>"Where was Otso born and nurtured,</l>
        <l>Whence was formed his hide so shaggy,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Otso was not born in straw-bed.</l>
        <l>Nor was born on chaff in malt-house;</l>
        <l>There was Otso brought to being,</l>
        <l>There was born the honey-pawed one,</l>
        <l>Near the moon, in gleams of sunshine,</l>
        <l>And upon the Great Bear's shoulders,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>

        <l>"On Air's borders walked a maiden,</l>
        <l>Through mid heaven there walked a damsel,</l>
        <l>Through the rifted clouds she wandered,</l>
        <l>On the borders of the heavens,</l>
        <l>Clad in stockings, blue in colour,</l>
        <l>And with shoes most gaily coloured,</l>
        <l>In her hand a wool-filled satchel,</l>
        <l>'Neath her arm a hair-filled basket.</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>Wool she cast upon the waters,</l>

        <l>And the air unceasing rocked it,</l>
        <l>And the breeze on water rocked it,</l>
        <l>To the shore the waves impelled it,</l>
        <l>To the edge of honeyed forest,</l>
        <l>To the end of honeyed headland.</l>

        <l>Tapiola's accomplished matron,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>Took the wool from out the water,</l>
        <l>Took the soft wool from the billows.</l>
        <l>Then she wrapped it all together,</l>
        <l>With a handsome band she wrapped it,</l>
        <l>Put it in her maple basket,</l>
        <l>In a beauteous cradle laid it,</l>
        <l>Then she lifted up the bundle,</l>
        <l>And the golden chains she carried</l>
        <l>Where the branches were the thickest</l>
        <l>And the leaves were most abundant.</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>

        <l>Underneath a spreading fir-tree,</l>
        <l>Underneath a blooming pine-tree.</l>
        <l>Thus it was the bear was nurtured,</l>
        <l>And the furry beast was fostered,</l>
        <l>There beside a bush of honey,</l>
        <l>In a forest dripping honey.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Now the bear grew up most handsome,</l>
        <l>And attained his perfect stature.</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        <l>Short his legs, his knees were crooked,</l>
        <l>Broad his nose, both thick and stumpy,</l>
        <l>Broad his head and short his muzzle,</l>
        <l>And his handsome hair was shaggy,</l>
        <l>But as yet the bear was tailless,</l>

        <l>Nor to evil purpose turns them.</l>

        <l>"Then the bear by oath engaged him,</l>

        <l>And in Jumala's high presence,</l>
        <l>'Fore the face of Him Almighty,</l>
        <l>Never would he work a mischief,</l>

        <l>From the hardest resinous tree-stumps,</l>
        <l>But she found no claws among them,</l>
        <l>Neither found she teeth among them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"On the heath there grew a pine-tree,</l>
        <l>On the hill there rose a fir-tree,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>

        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Very gracious was the forest,</l>

        <l>To the needle-covered pine-trees,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
        <l>To the hills all clothed with forest,</l>

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

        <l>All the handsome people asked him,</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
        <l>"Where have you bestowed your booty,</l>
        <l>Whither did you make your journey?</l>
        <l>Have you left him in the icefield,</l>

        <l>Buried him upon the heathland?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"In the ice I did not leave him,</l>
        <l>Sunk him not among the snow-slush,</l><ref type="line number">580</ref>
        <l>For the dogs from thence would drag him,</l>
        <l>Likewise would the birds befoul him.</l>
        <l>In the swamp I have not sunk him,</l>
        <l>Nor upon the heath have buried,</l>
        <l>For the worms would there destroy him</l>
        <l>And the black ants would devour him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Thither have I brought my booty,</l>
        <l>There bestowed my little captive,</l>

        <l>On a copper mountain's summit.</l><ref type="line number">590</ref>
        <l>In a splendid tree I laid him,</l>
        <l>Pine-tree with a hundred needles,</l>
        <l>In the very largest branches,</l>
        <l>In the broad and leafy summit,</l>
        <l>As a joy to men for ever,</l>
        <l>And a pleasure to the travellers.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Then I turned his gums to eastward,</l>
        <l>And his eyes I turned to north-west,</l>
        <l>Not too high upon the summit,</l>
        <l>Lest if they were in the summit,</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
        <l>Then the wind might perhaps destroy them,</l>
        <l>And the spring wind treat them badly.</l>
        <l>Nor too near the ground I placed them,</l>
        <l>Lest if I too low had laid them,</l>
        <l>Then the pigs might perhaps disturb them,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>

        </lg>

        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

        <l>"Keep thy light, O holder, shining,</l>
        <l>So that I can see while singing,</l>
        <l>For the time has come for singing,</l>
        <l>And my mouth to sing is longing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Played and sang old Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Charming all throughout the evening,</l>
        <l>And when he had ceased his singing,</l>
        <l>Then a speech he made concluding:</l><ref type="line number">620</ref>

        <head>THE ROBBERY OF THE SUN AND MOON</head>
        <div type="argument">
        The moon and sun descend to listen to Väinämöinen's playing. The Mistress of Pohjola succeeds in capturing them, hides them in a mountain, and steals the fire from the homes of Kalevala (1-40). Ukko, the Supreme God, is surprised at the darkness in the sky, and kindles fire for a new moon and a new sun (41-82). The fire falls to the ground, and Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen go to search for it (83-126). The Virgin of the Air informs them that the fire has fallen into Lake Alue, and has been swallowed by a fish (127-312). Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen try to catch the fish with a net of bast, but without success (313-364).

        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>On his kantele was playing,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>In the moon's house heard they playing</l>
        <l>Came delight to the sun's window,</l>
        <l>And the moon came from his dwelling,</l>
        <l>Standing on a crooked birch-tree,</l>
        <l>And the sun came from his castle,</l>
        <l>Sitting on a fir-tree's summit,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>To the kantele to listen,</l>
        <l>Filled with wonder and rejoicing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Set to work the sun to capture,</l>
        <l>In her hands the moon seized likewise.</l>
        <l>From the birch the moon she captured,</l>

        <l>Then she hid the moon from shining,</l>

        <l>Sang the sun to shine no longer,</l>
        <l>Hidden in a steel-hard mountain;</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>

        <l>Shall the moon arise for shining,</l>
        <l>Nor the sun be free for shining,</l>

        <l>Which a single mare has littered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When the moon away was carried,</l>
        <l>And the sun had been imprisoned</l>
        <l>Deep in Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
        <l>In the rocks as hard as iron,</l>
        <l>Then she stole away the brightness,</l>
        <l>And from Väinölä the fires,</l>
        <l>And she left the houses fireless,</l>
        <l>And the rooms no flame illumined.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>

        <l>Therefore was the night unending,</l>
        <l>And for long was utter darkness,</l>
        <l>Night in Kalevala for ever,</l>
        <l>And in Väinölä's fair dwellings,</l>
        <l>Likewise in the heavens was darkness,</l>
        <l>Darkness round the seat of Ukko.</l>
        </lg>

        <l>Life without the fire was weary,</l>
        <l>And without the light a burden,</l>

        <l>And to Ukko's self 'twas dismal.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>

        <l>Ukko, then, of Gods the highest,</l>
        <l>In the air the great Creator,</l>
        <l>Now began to feel most strangely,</l>

        <l>How the sun had been obstructed,</l>
        <l>That the moon would shine no longer,</l>
        <l>And the sun had ceased his shining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he stepped to cloudland's borders,</l>
        <l>On the borders of the heavens,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>Wearing now his pale blue stockings,</l>
        <l>With the heels of varied colour,</l>
        <l>And he went the moon to seek for,</l>
        <l>And he went to find the sunlight,</l>
        <l>Yet he could not find the moonlight,</l>
        <l>Nor the sun he could discover.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the air a light struck Ukko,</l>
        <l>And a flame did Ukko kindle,</l>
        <l>From his flaming sword he struck it,</l>
        <l>Sparks he struck from off the sword-blade,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>From his nails he struck the fire,</l>
        <l>From his limbs he made it crackle,</l>

        <l>On the starry plains of heaven.</l>
        <l>When the fire had thus been kindled,</l>
        <l>Then he took the spark of fire,</l>
        <l>In his golden purse he thrust it,</l>
        <l>Placed it in his silver casket,</l>
        <l>And he bade the maiden rock it,</l>
        <l>Told the maid of air to rock it,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>That a new moon might be fashioned,</l>
        <l>And a new sun be constructed.</l>

        <lg>
        <l>On the long cloud's edge she sat her,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the silver props were shaken,</l>

        <l>And the rocking of the brightness.</l>

        <l>Thus the maid the fire was rocking,</l>
        <l>And she rocked the fire to brightness,</l>
        <l>With her fingers moved the fire,</l>
        <l>With her hands the fire she tended,</l>

        <l>From her hands the fire dropped downward</l>
        <l>From the fingers of its guardian.</l>

        <l>As it through the clouds dropped downward,</l>
        <l>Through nine heavens the drop descended,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon set forth the heroes,</l>

        <l>How they might succeed in finding,</l>
        <l>Where the fire had just descended,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>And a river flowed before them,</l>

        <l>And the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Straight began a boat to fashion,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>In the wood he worked upon it,</l>
        <l>And beside him Ilmarinen</l>

        <l>Made it from a log of pinewood.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus the boat at length was ready,</l>
        <l>Rowlocks, rudder all completed,</l>
        <l>And they pushed it in the water,</l>
        <l>And they rowed and steered it onward,</l>
        <l>All along the river Neva,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Eager now to make a capture,</l>
        <l>Then he cast the net and sunk it,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>But he cast the net out twisted,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the water went the brothers,</l>
        <l>To the net the men proceeded,</l>

        <l>And they pulled it and they dragged it,</l>

        <head>THE CAPTURE OF THE FIRE</head>
        <div type="argument">
        The heroes prepare a linen net, and at length capture the fish which has swallowed the fire (1-192). The fire is found in the fish's belly, but flashes up suddenly, and burns Ilmarinen's cheeks and hands severely (193-248). The fire rushes into the forest, burns over many countries, and spreads further and further, till at length it is captured and carried to the dark dwellings of Kalevala (249-290). Ilmarinen recovers from his burns (291-372).
        </div>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
        <l>Thereupon began to ponder,</l>
        <l>And reflected on the method</l>
        <l>How to make a net of linen,</l>
        <l>How to make the hundred meshes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
        <l>"Is there one who flax can sow me,</l>
        <l>Who can sow the flax and card it,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>And of this a net can make me,</l>
        <l>Weave for me its hundred meshes,</l>
        <l>Thus this wretched fish to slaughter,</l>
        <l>And destroy the fish unhappy?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>So a little spot they found him,</l>
        <l>Found a place not yet burned over,</l>
        <l>In the wide extent of marshes,</l>
        <l>There between two stumps they found it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon they dug the roots out,</l>
        <l>And 'twas there they found the flaxseed,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>Guarded by the worm of Tuoni,</l>
        <l>There protected by the earthworm.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>There they found a heap of ashes;</l>
        <l>Dry the ashes that they found there,</l>
        <l>Of a wooden burned-up vessel,</l>
        <l>Of a boat that once had burned there.</l>
        <l>There it was they sowed the flaxseed,</l>
        <l>In the loose ash did they sow it,</l>
        <l>On the shore of Lake of Alue,</l>
        <l>There they sowed it in the clayfield.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Presently the shoot rose upward,</l>
        <l>And the flax grew thick and strongly,</l>
        <l>Grew beyond their expectations,</l>
        <l>In a single night of summer.</l>
        <l>Then they steeped it in the night-time,</l>
        <l>And they carded it by moonlight,</l>
        <l>And they cleansed it and they stripped it,</l>
        <l>And they beat it and they rubbed it,</l>
        <l>With their tools of steel they scraped it,</l>
        <l>And with all their strength they stripped it. 40</l>
        <l>Then they took the flax to steeping,</l>
        <l>And it soon began to soften,</l>
        <l>And they hastened then to pound it,</l>
        <l>Afterwards in haste they dried it.</l>

        <l>Then into the house they brought it,</l>

        <l>And they hastened next to beat it,</l>
        <l>And they hastened then to break it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then with diligence they cleansed it,</l>
        <l>In the twilight did they comb it,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>And upon the loom arranged it,</l>
        <l>Quicker brought it to the spindle,</l>
        <l>In a single night of summer;</l>
        <l>Thus between two days they worked it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this the sisters spun it,</l>
        <l>And their brothers' wives were netting,</l>
        <l>And the brothers worked the meshes,</l>
        <l>And the fathers also aided.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Quickly did they turn the netter,</l>
        <l>And the mesh with speed they twisted,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>Till the net was quite completed,</l>
        <l>And the cords were fixed upon it,</l>
        <l>In a single night of summer,</l>
        <l>Half another in addition.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus the net was quite completed,</l>
        <l>And the cords were fixed upon it.</l>
        <l>And its length was hundred fathoms,</l>
        <l>And its breadth was hundreds seven;</l>
        <l>Stones for weights were fastened to it,</l>
        <l>Likewise proper floats provided.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>With the net the youths were walking,</l>
        <l>And at home the old men pondered,</l>
        <l>Whether they would make a capture,</l>
        <l>And secure the fish they wished for.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then they drew the net and dragged it,</l>
        <l>Much they toiled, and threshed the water,</l>
        <l>Drew it lengthwise through the water,</l>
        <l>Dragged it crosswise through the water,</l>
        <l>Captured many little fishes,</l>
        <l>Many luckless perch they captured,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        <l>Many bony perch they captured,</l>
        <l>And a large-galled Redeye likewise,</l>
        <l>But the fish they could not capture</l>
        <l>That for which the net was fashioned.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Let us now go forth together</l>
        <l>Where the net is in the water.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon went both the heroes,</l>
        <l>And they drew it through the water,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>And upon one side they spread it</l>
        <l>Round the islands in the water,</l>

        <l>Round about the promontories,</l>

        <l>Just as aged Väinö pushed it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus they cast the net and pushed it,</l>
        <l>And they drew the net and dragged it,</l>
        <l>Captured fishes in abundance,</l>
        <l>And they captured perch in plenty,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>Salmon-trout in great abundance,</l>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Worked to make the net yet longer,</l>
        <l>Wider yet the sides expanded,</l>
        <l>Perhaps five hundred fathoms broader,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>Netted full seven hundred fathoms,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the depths the nets they carried,</l>

        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Vellamo, O Water-Mother,</l>
        <l>Old one with the lavish bosom,</l>
        <l>Do thou change the shift upon thee,</l>
        <l>Do thou change thy dress completely,</l>
        <l>For thou hast a shift of rushes,</l>
        <l>On thy head a cap of lake-foam,</l>
        <l>Fashioned by the Wind's fair daughter,</l>
        <l>Which the billows' daughter gave thee.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>Now assume a shift of linen,</l>
        <l>Of the finest flax that's woven,</l>
        <l>Which by Kuutar has been woven,</l>
        <l>Päivätär has wrought when spinning.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Ahto, master of the billows,</l>
        <l>Ruler thou of caves a hundred,</l>
        <l>Take thy pole in length five fathoms,</l>
        <l>Take thy stake, in length full seven,</l>
        <l>Thresh with this the open water,</l>
        <l>And do thou stir up the lake-bed,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>Stir thou all the heaps of refuse,</l>
        <l>Drive thou on the shoals of fishes,</l>
        <l>Where the net is spread to catch them,</l>
        <l>And its hundred floats are swimming,</l>
        <l>From the bays by fish frequented,</l>
        <l>From the caves where hide the salmon,</l>
        <l>From the wide lake's seething whirlpool,</l>
        <l>And from the profound abysses,</l>
        <l>Where the sun was never shining,</l>
        <l>Undisturbed the sand for ever."</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the lake a dwarf ascended,</l>
        <l>From the waves arose a hero,</l>
        <l>Stood upon the lake's broad surface,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Is there need to thresh the water,</l>
        <l>With a long pole to disturb it?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"There is need to thresh the water,</l>
        <l>With a long pole to disturb it."</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>Then the dwarf, the little hero,</l>
        <l>Lifted from the bank a pine-tree,</l>
        <l>Took a tall tree from the pinewood,</l>
        <l>And prepared to thresh the water,</l>
        <l>And he asked, and spoke as follows:</l>
        <l>"Shall I thresh with strength sufficient,</l>
        <l>Putting forth my utmost efforts,</l>
        <l>Or as hard as may be needful?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Old and prudent Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>"If you thresh as hard as needful,</l>
        <l>You will have to do much threshing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the man, the little hero,</l>
        <l>Set to work to thresh the water,</l>
        <l>And he threshed as much as needful,</l>
        <l>And he drove the shoals of fishes,</l>
        <l>And into the net he drove them,</l>
        <l>In the net with floats a hundred.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Rested now the smith his oars;</l>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>Now the net himself drew upward,</l>
        <l>At the rope as he was pulling.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>"We have caught a shoal of fishes,</l>
        <l>In the net that I am lifting,</l>
        <l>With a hundred floats provided.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the net was soon drawn upward,</l>
        <l>And they drew it up and shook it</l>
        <l>In the boat of Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Finding mid the shoal of fishes,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        <l>That for which the net was fashioned,</l>
        <l>And the hundred floats provided.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>To the land then urged the vessel,</l>
        <l>To the blue bridge-side he brought it,</l>
        <l>To the red bridge-end he brought it,</l>
        <l>There the shoal of fishes sorted,</l>
        <l>Turned the heap of bony fishes,</l>
        <l>And the grey pike found among them,</l>
        <l>Which he long had sought to capture.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Thus unto himself reflected:</l>
        <l>"Is it wise with hands to seize it,</l>
        <l>Save with gauntlets made of iron,</l>
        <l>Save with gloves of stone constructed,</l>
        <l>Save with mittens made of copper?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the Sun's son heard him speaking,</l>
        <l>And replied in words that follow:</l>
        <l>"I myself would rip the pike up,</l>
        <l>Venture in my hand to take him,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        <l>If I had my large knife only,</l>
        <l>Which my noble father gave me.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then from heaven the knife descended,</l>
        <l>From the clouds the knife fell downward,</l>
        <l>Golden-hafted, silver-bladed,</l>
        <l>To the Sun's son's belt dropped downward.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon the Sun's son seized it,</l>
        <l>Firmly in his hand he grasped it,</l>
        <l>And with this the pike ripped open,</l>
        <l>Cleft the body of the Broad-snout,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>And within the grey pike's belly</l>
        <l>There the grey trout he discovered,</l>
        <l>And within the grey trout's belly</l>
        <l>There he found the smooth-skinned powan.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he split the smooth-skinned powan,</l>
        <l>And a blue clew he discovered,</l>
        <l>In the powan's entrails hidden,</l>
        <l>In the third fold of the entrails.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the blue clew he unwinded;</l>
        <l>From the inside of the blue clew</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Fell a red clew from within it,</l>
        <l>And when he unwound the red clew,</l>
        <l>In the middle of the red clew,</l>
        <l>There he found a spark of fire</l>
        <l>Which had once from heaven descended,</l>
        <l>Through the clouds had fallen downward,</l>
        <l>From above eight heavens descending,</l>
        <l>From the ninth aërial region.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen then considered</l>
        <l>How the spark might best be carried,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>To the cold and fireless dwellings,</l>
        <l>To the rooms so dark and gloomy.</l>
        <l>But the fire flashed up most fiercely,</l>
        <l>From the Sun's son's hands who held it,</l>
        <l>Singed the beard of Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Burned the smith much more severely,</l>
        <l>For upon his cheeks it burned him,</l>
        <l>And upon his hands it scorched him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And it hastened quickly onward</l>
        <l>O'er the waves of Lake of Alue,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>Through the junipers fled onward,</l>
        <l>Burnt its way through all the thicket,</l>
        <l>Then rushed upward through the fir-trees,</l>
        <l>Burning up the stately fir-trees,</l>
        <l>Rushing ever further onward,</l>
        <l>Burned up half the land of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And the furthest bounds of Savo,</l>
        <l>Over both halves of Carelia.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Followed hard upon its traces,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>And he hastened through the forest,</l>
        <l>Close behind the furious fire,</l>
        <l>And at length he overtook it,</l>
        <l>'Neath the roots of two great tree-stumps,</l>
        <l>In the stumps of alders hidden,</l>
        <l>In the rotten stumps he found it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Fire, whom Jumala created,</l>
        <l>Creature of the bright Creator,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>Idly to the depths thou goest,</l>
        <l>Aimlessly to distant regions.</l>
        <l>It were better far to hide thee</l>
        <l>In the hearth of stone constructed,</l>
        <l>There thy sparks to bind together,</l>
        <l>And within the coals enclose them,</l>
        <l>That by day thou may'st be flickering</l>
        <l>In the kitchen birchen faggots,</l>
        <l>And at night thou may'st be hidden</l>
        <l>Close within the golden fire-box."</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he thrust the spark of fire</l>
        <l>In a little piece of tinder,</l>
        <l>In the fungus hard of birch-tree,</l>
        <l>And among the copper kettles.</l>
        <l>Fire he carried to the kettles,</l>
        <l>Took it in the bark of birch-tree,</l>
        <l>To the end of misty headland,</l>
        <l>And the shady island's summit.</l>
        <l>Now was fire within the dwellings,</l>
        <l>In the rooms again 'twas shining.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But the smith named Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Quickly hastened to the lakeshore,</l>
        <l>Where the rocks the water washes,</l>
        <l>And upon the rocks he sat him,</l>
        <l>In the pain of burning fire,</l>
        <l>In the anguish of its glowing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>There it was he quenched the fire,</l>
        <l>There it was he dimmed its lustre,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>"Fire whom Jumala created</l>
        <l>And O thou, the Sun's son, Panu!</l>

        <l>And to burn my hips so badly,</l>
        <l>And my sides so much to injure.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"How shall I the fire extinguish,</l>
        <l>How shall I reduce its glowing,</l>
        <l>Make the fire for evil powerless,</l>
        <l>And its lustre render harmless,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>That no longer it may pain me,</l>

        Ilmarinen forges a new moon and sun but cannot make them shine (1-74). Väinämöinen discovers by divination that the moon and sun are hidden in the mountain of Pohjola, goes to Pohjola and conquers the whole nation (75-230). He sees the moon and sun in the mountain, but cannot enter (231-278). He returns home to procure tools with which to break open the mountain. While Ilmarinen is forging them, the Mistress of Pohjola, fearing that it may go ill with her, releases the moon and sun (279-362). When Väinämöinen sees the moon and sun reappear in the sky, he salutes them, hoping that they will always go brightly on their course, and bring happiness to the country (363-422).

        <lg>
        <l>Came the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>And beside the door he sat him,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou smith, my dearest brother,</l>
        <l>What art thou in smithy forging,</l>
        <l>Hammering thus without cessation?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Out of gold a moon I'm shaping,</l>
        <l>And a sun of silver making,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
        <l>In the sky I then will place them,</l>
        <l>Over six of starry heavens.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>What you make is wholly useless.</l>
        <l>Gold will never shine like moonlight,</l>
        <l>Silver will not shine like sunlight.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus the smith a moon constructed,</l>
        <l>And a sun completely finished,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
        <l>Eagerly he raised them upward,</l>
        <l>Raised them to the best position,</l>
        <l>Raised the moon to fir-tree's summit,</l>
        <l>Set the sun upon a pine-tree.</l>
        <l>From his head the sweat was streaming,</l>
        <l>From his forehead sweat was falling,</l>
        <l>With the greatness of his efforts,</l>
        <l>And the weight that he was lifting.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thus the moon was now uplifted,</l>
        <l>In his place the sun was stationed,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
        <l>Moon amid the crown of fir-tree,</l>
        <l>Sun upon a pine-tree's summit,</l>
        <l>But the moon shed forth no lustre,</l>
        <l>And the sun was likewise rayless.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Time it is the lots to shuffle,</l>
        <l>And the signs with care to question</l>
        <l>Where the sun is hidden from us,</l>
        <l>And the moon has vanished from us."</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
        <l>Hastened alder-sticks to cut him,</l>
        <l>And arranged the sticks in order,</l>
        <l>And began the lots to shuffle,</l>
        <l>With his fingers to arrange them,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Leave I ask of the Creator,</l>
        <l>Seek an answer that misleads not.</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
        <l>Tell me, signs of the Creator,</l>
        <l>Lots of Jumala, instruct me,</l>
        <l>Where the sun is hidden from us,</l>
        <l>And the moon has vanished from us,</l>
        <l>Since no more as time elapses,</l>
        <l>In the sky do we behold them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>"Speak, O lot, and tell me truly</l>
        <l>With man's reason speak unto me,</l>
        <l>Speak thou faithful words unto us,</l>
        <l>Make thou faithful compacts with us!</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
        <l>If the lot should lie unto me,</l>
        <l>Then its worth I hold as nothing,</l>
        <l>And upon the fire will cast it,</l>
        <l>And will burn the signs upon it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And the lot spoke words most faithful,</l>
        <l>And the signs made answer truly,</l>
        <l>For they said the sun was hidden,</l>
        <l>And the moon was also sunken,</l>
        <l>Deep in Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
        <l>And within the hill of copper.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"I to Pohjola must journey,</l>
        <l>On the path of Pohja's children,</l>
        <l>And will bring the moon to shining,</l>
        <l>And the golden sun to shining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Forth he journeyed, and he hastened</l>
        <l>Unto Pohjola's dark regions,</l>
        <l>And he walked one day, a second,</l>
        <l>And at length upon the third day</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
        <l>Came in view the gate of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And appeared the rocky mountains.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then with all his strength he shouted,</l>
        <l>As he came to Pohja's river,</l>
        <l>"Bring me here a boat directly</l>
        <l>Which shall take me o'er the river.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>As his shouting was not heeded,</l>
        <l>And no boat for him provided,</l>
        <l>Wood into a heap he gathered,</l>
        <l>And the dead twigs of a fir-tree.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
        <l>On the shore he made a fire,</l>
        <l>And thick clouds of smoke rose upward;</l>
        <l>To the sky the flame rose upward,</l>
        <l>In the air the smoke ascended.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
        <l>Came herself unto the window,</l>
        <l>And, at the sound's opening gazing,</l>
        <l>Then she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"What's the flame that's burning yonder,</l>
        <l>Where the Sound of Saari opens?</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
        <l>For a camp too small I think it,</l>
        <l>But 'tis larger than a fisher's.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the son of Pohja's country</l>
        <l>Hurried out into the open,</l>
        <l>And he looked about and listened,</l>
        <l>Seeking thus for information.</l>
        <l>"On the river's other margin,</l>
        <l>Is a stately hero marching.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Once again commenced his shouting.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
        <l>"Bring a boat, O son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Bring a boat for Väinämöinen.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answer made the son of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And in words like these responded:</l>
        <l>"Here the boats are never ready;</l>
        <l>You to row must use your fingers,</l>
        <l>And must use your hands for rudder,</l>
        <l>Crossing Pohjola's deep river.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Pondered deeply and reflected,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
        <l>"Not as man should he be reckoned</l>
        <l>Who retreats upon his pathway.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Like a pike in lake then plunging,</l>
        <l>Powan-like in sluggish river,</l>
        <l>Through the sound he swam right quickly,</l>
        <l>Speedily the strait he traversed,</l>
        <l>And he moved one foot, a second,</l>
        <l>And he reached the shore of Pohja.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then spoke out the sons of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And the evil army shouted:</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>"Go into the yard of Pohja,"</l>
        <l>And on this the yard he entered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then exclaimed the sons of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And the evil army shouted:</l>
        <l>"Enter now the house of Pohja."</l>
        <l>And on this the house he entered,</l>
        <l>On the floor his foot he planted,</l>
        <l>Grasped he the door-handle firmly,</l>
        <l>Forced his way into the dwelling,</l>
        <l>And beneath the roof he entered,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>There the men the mead were drinking,</l>
        <l>And the honey-drink imbibing.</l>
        <l>All the men with swords were girded,</l>
        <l>And the heroes aimed their weapons</l>
        <l>At the head of Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Thus to slay Suvantolainen.</l>
        <l>Then they questioned the intruder</l>
        <l>In the very words that follow:</l>
        <l>"What's your news, you wretched fellow,</l>
        <l>What's your need, O swimming hero?"</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Of the moon are curious tidings,</l>
        <l>Of the sun are wondrous tidings.</l>
        <l>Where is now the sun imprisoned,</l>
        <l>Whither has the moon been taken?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Answered then the sons of Pohja,</l>
        <l>And the evil army answered:</l>
        <l>"Thus it is the sun is hidden,</l>
        <l>Sun is hidden, moon imprisoned,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
        <l>In the stones of many colours,</l>
        <l>In the rocks as hard as iron,</l>
        <l>And from this, escape they cannot,</l>
        <l>And release shall never reach them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"If the sun from rock ascends not,</l>
        <l>Nor the moon from rocky mountain,</l>
        <l>Let us join in closest conflict,</l>
        <l>Let us grasp our trusty sword-blades."</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Sword they drew, and tried their sword-blades,</l>
        <l>Drew from out the sheaths their weapons;</l>
        <l>At the point the moon was shining,</l>
        <l>On the hilt the sun was shining,</l>
        <l>On the back a horse was standing,</l>
        <l>At the knob a cat was mewing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>After this the swords they measured,</l>
        <l>And they thus compared their weapons,</l>
        <l>And the sword of aged Väinö</l>
        <l>Was a little trifle longer,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        <l>Longer, as a grain of barley,</l>
        <l>As the width of straw-stalk longer.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Out into the yard they hastened,</l>
        <l>On the grass to meet in conflict,</l>
        <l>And the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Struck a blow with lightning swiftness,</l>
        <l>Struck a blow, and struck a second,</l>
        <l>And he sheared, like roots of turnips,</l>
        <l>Off he shore, like heads of flax-plant,</l>
        <l>Heads of all the sons of Pohja.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Sought for where the moon was hidden,</l>
        <l>Likewise would release the sunlight</l>
        <l>From the rocks of varied colour,</l>
        <l>From the depths of steely mountain,</l>
        <l>From the rocks as hard as iron.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he walked a little distance,</l>
        <l>But a very little distance,</l>
        <l>When he saw a copse all verdant,</l>
        <l>In the copse a lovely birch-tree,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>And a large stone block beneath it,</l>
        <l>And a rock beneath the stone block,</l>
        <l>And there were nine doors before it,</l>
        <l>In the doors were bolts a hundred.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In the stone a crack perceiving,</l>
        <l>In the rock some lines engraven,</l>
        <l>Then he drew his sword from scabbard,</l>
        <l>On the coloured stone he scraped it,</l>
        <l>With the sharp point of his sword-blade,</l>
        <l>With his gleaming blade he scraped it,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        <l>Till the stone in two divided,</l>
        <l>And in three he quickly split it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Looked into the stone all pictured;</l>
        <l>Many serpents ale were drinking,</l>
        <l>In the wort the snakes were writhing,</l>
        <l>In the coloured stone were hiding,</l>
        <l>In the cracks of liver-colour.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Uttered then the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        <l>"Thus it is the hapless Mistress</l>
        <l>Has so little ale acquired,</l>
        <l>For the snakes the ale are drinking,</l>
        <l>In the wort the snakes are writhing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Off he cut the heads of serpents,</l>
        <l>Broke the necks of all the serpents,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>
        <l>"Never while the world existeth,</l>
        <l>From this very day henceforward,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        <l>Let our ale by snakes be drunken,</l>
        <l>And our malt-drink by the serpents.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
        <l>Sought with hands the doors to open,</l>
        <l>And the bolts by spells to loosen,</l>
        <l>But to hands the doors would yield not,</l>
        <l>By his spells the bolts were moved not.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Spoke his thoughts in words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>"Man unarmed is weak as woman;</l>
        <l>Weak as frog, without a hatchet."</l>
        <l>And at once he wended homeward,</l>
        <l>Head bowed down, in great vexation,</l>
        <l>For the moon was not recovered,</l>
        <l>Neither had the sun been captured.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
        <l>"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Wherefore didst forget to take me,</l>
        <l>As your very trusty comrade?</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>I had brought the locks to creaking,</l>
        <l>And the bars asunder broken,</l>
        <l>And released the moon for shining,</l>
        <l>And had raised the sun for shining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Unto spells the bolts will yield not,</l>
        <l>And the locks my magic breaks not;</l>
        <l>Strength of hands will never move them,</l>
        <l>And no strength of arm will force them."</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>To the smith's forge then he wandered,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>Forge me now a mighty trident,</l>
        <l>And a dozen hatchets forge me,</l>
        <l>And a bunch of keys enormous,</l>
        <l>From the stone the moon to rescue,</l>
        <l>From the rock the sun deliver.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
        <l>He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>Forged the hero what he needed,</l>
        <l>And a dozen hatchets forged him,</l>
        <l>Forged a bunch of keys enormous,</l>
        <l>And of spears a mighty bundle,</l>
        <l>Not too large and not too little,</l>
        <l>But of middle size he forged them.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Then with wings herself provided,</l>
        <l>And extended them for flying,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>Near the house at first was flying,</l>
        <l>Then her flight extended further,</l>
        <l>Straight across the lake of Pohja</l>
        <l>Unto Ilmarinen's smithy.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the smith his window opened,</l>
        <l>Looking if the wind was blowing;</l>
        <l>'Twas no wind that there was blowing,</l>
        <l>But a hawk, and grey in colour.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Spoke aloud the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>"Bird of prey, what brings thee hither,</l>
        <l>Sitting underneath my window?.</l>
        </lg>

        <l>And the hawk at once made answer:</l>

        <l>Thou the most industrious craftsman,</l>
        <l>Truly art thou very skilful,</l>
        <l>And a most accomplished craftsman.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>"But indeed 'tis not a wonder</l>
        <l>If I am a skilful craftsman,</l>
        <l>For 'twas I who forged the heavens,</l>
        <l>And the arch of air who welded.</l>
        </lg>

        <l>Hereupon the bird spoke language,</l>
        <l>And the hawk at once responded:</l>
        <l>"What is this, O smith, thou makest,</l>
        <l>What, O blacksmith, art thou forging?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
        <l>"'Tis a neck-ring I am forging,</l>
        <l>For the aged crone of Pohja,</l>
        <l>That she may be firmly fettered</l>
        <l>To the side of a great mountain.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
        <l>Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
        <l>Felt on this her doom was coming,</l>
        <l>On her head the days of evil,</l>
        <l>And at once to flight betook her,</l>
        <l>Swift to Pohjola escaping.</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the stone the moon released she,</l>
        <l>From the rock the sun released she,</l>
        <l>Then again her form she altered,</l>
        <l>And to dove herself converted,</l>
        <l>And her flight again directed</l>
        <l>Unto Ilmarinen's smithy,</l>
        <l>To the door in bird-form flying,</l>
        <l>Lit as dove upon the threshold.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Asked her in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
        <l>"Why, O bird, hast thou flown hither?</l>
        <l>Dove, why sit'st thou on the threshold?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>From the door the wild bird answered,</l>
        <l>And the dove spoke from the threshold:</l>
        <l>"Here I sit upon the threshold,</l>
        <l>That the news I now may bring thee.</l>
        <l>From the stone the moon has risen,</l>
        <l>From the rock the sun is loosened.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
        <l>Hastened forth to gaze around him,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
        <l>And he stood at door of smithy,</l>
        <l>Gazing anxiously to heaven,</l>
        <l>And he saw the moon was gleaming,</l>
        <l>And he saw the sun was shining.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then he went to Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
        <l>Thou the great primeval minstrel,</l>
        <l>Come to gaze upon the moonlight,</l>
        <l>Come to gaze upon the sunlight.</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
        <l>Now they stand in midst of heaven,</l>
        <l>In their old accustomed places.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
        <l>Hurried out into the open,</l>
        <l>And at once his head uplifted,</l>
        <l>And he gazed aloft to heaven.</l>
        <l>Moon was risen, sun was loosened,</l>
        <l>In the sky the sun was beaming.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
        <l>Made a speech without delaying,</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
        <l>And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed him:</l>

        <l>Thus thy fair cheeks well displaying,</l>
        <l>Golden sun who risest yonder,</l>

        The virgin Marjatta swallows a cranberry and brings forth a boy (1-346). The child disappears and is found after a long search in a swamp (347-430). He is taken to an old man to be baptized, but the latter will not baptize the fatherless child until after due consideration (431-440). Väinämöinen comes to inquire into the matter, and advises that the ill-omened boy should be put to death, but the child reproaches him for his unjust sentence (441-474). The old man baptizes the boy as King of Carelia, at which Väinämöinen is grievously offended and leaves the country, but first declares that he will again make a new Sampo and kantele, and light for the people. He sails away in a copper boat to a land between earth and heaven, but he leaves behind his kantele and his great songs as a parting gift to his people (475-512). Concluding verses (513-620).

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And she wore out half the threshold,</l>
        <l>With her skirts as she was passing,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
        <l>And she half destroyed the rafters</l>
        <l>Where she hung her silken ribands,</l>

        <l>As her fine sleeves rubbed against them,</l>

        <l>Wore away beneath her slippers.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Marjatta the petted damsel</l>
        <l>Was a very little damsel,</l>
        <l>And was always pure and holy,</l>
        <l>And was ever very modest,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
        <l>And she fed on fish the finest,</l>

        <l>If her mother sent her milking,</l>
        <l>Yet she did not go to milking,</l>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Never such a maid as I am</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
        <l>Udders of the cows should handle,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>On the hill the sheep were straying,</l>

        <l>Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>
        <l>For a while lived on as herd-girl.</l>

        <l>From the hill there cried a berry,</l>

        <l>From the heath a stick she lifted,</l>

        <l>Then from ground the berry mounted</l>
        <l>Upward to her shoes so pretty,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
        <l>From her pretty shoes arose it,</l>
        <l>Upward to her knees of whiteness,</l>

        <l>From her tongue to throat it glided,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Then she cast aside her girdle,</l>
        <l>Loosely dressed, without a girdle,</l>
        <l>Secretly she sought the bathroom,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And a baby gave her answer,</l>
        <l>And the little child made answer:</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>

        <lg>
        <l>And she bore her heavy burden,</l>

        <l>But her mother gave her answer,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>
        <l>Then replied to her in thiswise:</l>
        <l>"Neither with a man unmarried,</l>
        <l>Nor with any married hero,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
        <l>But I sought the hill of berries,</l>
        <l>And I went to pluck the cranberries,</l>

        <l>And it dropped into my stomach.</l>
        <l>Thus it is that I am pregnant,</l>
        <l>Thus it comes that I am pregnant.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>For a bath she asked her father,</l>
        <l>"O my very dearest father,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
        <l>Give me now a well-warmed refuge,</l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>But her father gave her answer,</l>
        <l>Gave her back a shameful answer:</l>
        <l>"Go thou forth from here, O strumpet,</l>
        <l>Wander forth, O wench for burning,</l>
        <l>To the bears' own rocky caverns,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>
        <l>Then returned submissive answer:</l>
        <l>"Not at all am I a strumpet,</l>
        <l>Neither am a wench for burning;</l>
        <l>I shall bear a mighty hero,</l>

        <l>Thereupon did our Marjatta</l>
        <l>Answer in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Go and ask a bath from Ruotus,</l>
        <l>Near where issues forth the Reed-brook."</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the little maiden Piltti</l>
        <l>Listened to her words obedient,</l>
        <l>Always ready, heedless never,</l>
        <l>Always quick, avoiding gossip,</l>
        <l>Like a mist, away she hurried,</l>
        <l>To the yard like snake she hastened,</l>
        <l>With her hands her skirts she lifted,</l>
        <l>In her hands her dress she twisted,</l>
        <l>And upon her course she hastened</l>
        <l>Straight unto the house of Ruotus.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
        <l>Hills re-echoed to her footsteps,</l>
        <l>Shook the mountains as she climbed them,</l>
        <l>On the heath the cones were dancing,</l>
        <l>Gravel scattered o'er the marshes;</l>
        <l>Thus she came to Ruotus' dwelling,</l>
        <l>And the house she quickly entered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In his shirt sat wicked Ruotus,</l>
        <l>Eating, drinking like the great ones,</l>
        <l>In his shirt at end of table,</l>
        <l>In a shirt of finest linen,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
        <l>And he asked as he was eating,</l>
        <l>Grunted, leaning o'er the table,</l>
        <l>"What have you to say, you beggar,</l>
        <l>Wretch, why come you running hither?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the little damsel Piltti</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Here I seek a village bathroom,</l>
        <l>Seek a bath near reed-fringed brooklet,</l>
        <l>That relief may reach the suffering,</l>
        <l>For the need is very pressing."</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the wicked wife of Ruotus</l>
        <l>Presently with arms a-kimbo,</l>
        <l>Slouched along upon the flooring,</l>
        <l>Swept to middle of the flooring,</l>
        <l>And she asked upon her coming,</l>
        <l>Speaking in the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"Who is seeking for a bathroom,</l>
        <l>Who is seeking for assistance?.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Said the little damsel Piltti,</l>
        <l>"Needed 'tis for our Marjatta."</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the wicked wife of Ruotus</l>
        <l>Answered in the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Vacant baths are rare in village,</l>
        <l>None at mouth of reed-fringed streamlet.</l>
        <l>There's a bath upon the clearing,</l>
        <l>And a stable in the pinewood,</l>
        <l>Where the whore may bear her children,</l>
        <l>And the vile one cast her offspring,</l>
        <l>While the horses there are breathing,</l>
        <l>Let her take a bath and welcome."</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the little maiden Piltti,</l>
        <l>Hurried back with rapid footsteps,</l>
        <l>And upon her course she hastened,</l>
        <l>And she said on her arrival:</l>
        <l>"In the village is no bathroom,</l>
        <l>None beside the rush-fringed streamlet,</l>
        <l>And the wicked wife of Ruotus,</l>
        <l>Only spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>'Vacant baths are none in village,</l>
        <l>None at mouth of reed-fringed streamlet.</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
        <l>There's a bath upon the clearing,</l>

        <l>And the vile one cast her offspring,</l>
        <l>While the horses there are breathing,</l>
        <l>Let her take a bath and welcome.'</l>
        <l>This was all she said unto me,</l>
        <l>This is truly what she answered.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Marjatta the hapless maiden</l>
        <l>When she heard, burst forth in weeping,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
        <l>And she spoke the words that follow:</l>
        <l>"Thither must I then betake me,</l>
        <l>Even like an outcast labourer,</l>
        <l>Even like a hired servant,</l>
        <l>I must go upon the clearing,</l>
        <l>And must wander to the pinewood.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>In her hands her skirt she lifted,</l>
        <l>With her hands her skirt she twisted,</l>
        <l>And she took the bath-whisks with her,</l>
        <l>Of the softest leaves and branches,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
        <l>And with hasty steps went onward,</l>
        <l>In the greatest pain of body,</l>
        <l>To the stable in the pinewood,</l>
        <l>And the stall on hill of Tapio.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>And she spoke the words which follow,</l>
        <l>And in words like these expressed her:</l>
        <l>"Come thou to my aid, Creator,</l>
        <l>To my aid, O thou most gracious,</l>
        <l>In this anxious time of labour,</l>
        <l>In this time of hardest labour.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
        <l>Free the damsel from her burden,</l>
        <l>From her pains release the woman,</l>
        <l>That she perish not in torment,</l>
        <l>May not perish in her anguish.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>When at length her journey ended,</l>
        <l>Then she spoke the words which follow:</l>
        <l>"O thou good horse, breathe upon me,</l>
        <l>O thou draught-foal, snort upon me,</l>
        <l>Breathe a vapour-bath around me,</l>
        <l>Send thou warmth throughout the bathroom,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
        <l>That relief may reach the sufferer,</l>
        <l>For the need is very pressing.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then the good horse breathed upon her,</l>
        <l>And the draught-foal snorted on her,</l>
        <l>Over all her suffering body.</l>
        <l>When the horse desisted breathing,</l>
        <l>Steam was spread throughout the stable,</l>
        <l>Like the steam of boiling water.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Marjatta the hapless maiden,</l>
        <l>She, the holy little maiden,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
        <l>Bathed her in a bath sufficient,</l>
        <l>Till she had relieved her suffering,</l>
        <l>And a little boy was born her,</l>
        <l>And a sinless child was given,</l>

        <l>On the hay in horses' manger.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
        <l>Then she washed the little infant,</l>
        <l>And in swaddling-clothes she wrapped him,</l>
        <l>On her knees she took the infant,</l>
        <l>And she wrapped her garments round him.</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
        <l>There she reared the little infant,</l>

        <lg>
        <l>On her knees she laid the infant,</l>
        <l>On her lap she laid the infant,</l>
        <l>And began to brush his hair straight,</l>

        <l>When from off her knees he vanished,</l>

        <l>Sought him through the hills and pinewoods,</l>
        <l>On the heath among the heather,</l>
        <l>Searched through every tuft of heather,</l>

        <l>Sentence gave in words that follow:</l>
        <l>"As the boy from marsh has risen,</l>

NOTES TO RUNOS XXVI-L

(These are by the translator, when not otherwise stated. K. K. indicates
Prof. Kaarle Krohn, and A. M. Madame Aino Malmberg. For proper names,
refer to the Glossary at page 281.)


RUNO XXVI

129. Literally, "his teeth."

230. In the _Völuspá_, we read of a Hall of Serpents in Naströnd, one of
the Icelandic hells, composed of serpents wattled together, with their
heads turned inwards, vomiting floods of venom in which wade murderers,
perjurers, and adulterers.

271. Literally, "the toads."

"Seven monarchs' wealth in that castle lies stowed;
 The foul fiends brood o'er them like raven and toad." (Scott.)

A diabolical creature, half dragon and half frog, is described in a
well-known Esthonian story.

427. _Tetrao tetrix_, known as the Black-cock and Grey-hen.

555. Virsta, a Russian word naturalized in Finnish.

617. This description recalls the serpents of Indian mythology, such as
those described in the first book of the _Mahabharata_.

619. Such a passage might have suggested to Longfellow the following:

"Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water,
 Broader than the Gitche Gumee."

 _Hiawatha_, xxi.


RUNO XXVII

208. Here commences a magical contest somewhat resembling the
transformation scenes in the stories of the Second Calendar, and of
Nooreddin and Bedreddin, in the _1001 Nights_.

326. "I don't want to have a mess made upon my floor here, or any noise
or shooting." (Tanta Coetzee, in Rider Haggard's _Jess_.)


RUNO XXVIII.

15, 16. His horse and sledge seem to have been transformed, like those
of Joukahainen in Runo III.

195. In Finnish and Esthonian tales we often find persons transformed
into trees and flowers; sometimes for purposes of concealment.


RUNO XXIX

242. "Grass-widows" are probably intended.

253-268. Even this old woman did not appeal to him in vain. We might
compare with this passage Byron's _Don Juan_, VIII., cxxxi., cxxxii.


RUNO XXX

175, 187. Literally, "nails."

185. Pakkanen, Puhurin poika. Frost, the son of the North Wind.

389. The unmanly lamentations of the heroes over a fate that has not
befallen them may remind us of Grimm's story of "Die kluge Else." It
will also be noticed that the heroes are only concerned about their
mothers; and Tiera has as little thought for his virgin bride as
Lemminkainen has for Kyllikki.


RUNO XXXI

1. The tragedy of Kullervo is the favourite episode of the _Kalevala_ in
Finland, next to that of Aino. The preamble (lines 1-10) is the same as
the opening of the Esthonian _Kalevipoeg_. The story of the Esthonian
hero, though he was a king and not a slave, resembles that of Kullervo
in so many respects that he must have been the same character
originally.

19. I think the change of style, indicative of different authorship, in
this episode is sufficiently obvious even in a translation. Many words
used here do not occur earlier in the poem.

91-96. The same story is told of the infant Kalevipoeg.

107. Esthonians call dwarfs "Ox-knee people"; _i. e._ people as high as
an ox's knee.

137. Like Simple Simon.

337. It is obvious that some of the youthful exploits of Kwasind
(slightly varied, after Longfellow's manner) are imitated from those of
Kullervo. (Compare also Runo XXXV., 11-68.)


RUNO XXXII

24. The rye-bread, on which the Finnish peasants largely subsist, is
described as baked in very hard round loaves, like quoits, which are
strung on a pole. But Kullervo's cake seems to have been prepared to
look nice on the outside.

156-162. Does this refer to stories of witches milking cattle?

206. Of juniper wood.

498. Literally, an apple-berry. Probably a small crab-apple is intended.

513. I think wolves are here intended, not dogs.

533. In the Esthonian story of the Northern Frog, the monster is secured
by an iron stake driven through the jaws. (Kirby's _Hero of Esthonia_,
II., 253, 256.)

542. These elaborate and ineffectual prayers and incantations may be
compared with the prayers of Achilles for the safety of Patroclus, in
_Iliad_, XVI.


RUNO XXXIII

40. Wheat is used in the folk-songs as a term of endearment. (K. K.)

61, 62. The Esthonian Kalevipoeg was constantly instructed by the voice
of birds.

285-290. In Esthonia this episode occurs in the story of the Royal
Herdboy. (_Hero of Esthonia_, I., pp. 279-305.)


RUNO XXXV

2. Are blue stockings supposed to be an emblem of strength? Ukko is also
represented as wearing them.

29."All with incredible stupendous force,
None daring to appear antagonist." (Milton.)

65. As Kalervo appears to have been a chief in his own right, it not
very clear why, or to whom, he had to pay taxes.

107, 108. The lake of course was frozen.

153. As in several other instances in the _Kalevala_, this does not
appear to be abduction in the modern sense, but merely marriage by
capture.

214. There is another celebrated poem written by a Finn, but in Swedish,
Runeberg's _Kong_ (King) _Fjalar_, in which a similar chance meeting
between a brother and sister forms the principal subject.

343. Sea-beasts are very rarely mentioned in the _Kalevala_, for nearly
all aquatic animals referred to are lake- or river-fish. Here the
allusion is probably to the story of Jonah.


RUNO XXXVI

80. Literally "the rest of his flesh." Having regard to the supposed
powers of Finnish magicians, this passage is not to be taken merely as
an impudent rejoinder, but as asserting powers which Kullervo actually
claimed to be able to exert.

307. In an old English romance we read concerning the suicide of a
sorcerer, "The ground whereon he died was ever afterwards unfortunate,
and to this present time it is called in that country, 'a vale of
walking spirits.'" (_Seven Champions of Christendom_, Part I., chap.
xix.)

327. This reminds us of Sir Peter's "Sword of Vengeance." (Prior's
_Danish Ballads_, I., pp. 269-275.)

341. The Esthonian Kalevipoeg was also slain, like Kullervo, by his own
sword. (_Hero of Esthonia_, I., pp. 140, 141.)


RUNO XXXVII

56. Literally, their hatless shoulders.

61. Compare the account of the forging of the Sampo in Runo X.


RUNO XXXVIII

94. This might allude to the Viking practice of carving the Blood-Eagle
on the backs of enemies; but Prof. Krohn remarks that this was unknown
in Finland.

255. Here it seems that the mere fact of Ilmarinen having carried off
the girl, even against her will, was enough to constitute her his lawful
wife.

273. Ilmarinen's sword was less bloodthirsty than that of Kullervo; but
it will be noticed that there is as little real chivalry in the
_Kalevala_ generally as in old Scandinavian literature.


RUNO XL

274. Literally, "at the tips of my ten nails."


RUNO XLI

238. Similar incidents are common in folktales. The reader will
recollect the decoration of Mama, the Woodpecker. (_Hiawatha_, IX.)


RUNO XLII

1-3. Here again we notice a difference of expression, indicating a
different authorship.

52. "Mistress of the mighty spell." (Southey.)

146. Compare Runo XX., lines 17-118.

295. Literally, his finger-bones.

403. Perhaps the cap had ear-flaps to be worn in bad weather.


RUNO XLIII

37, 38. This seems to be meant ironically.

115-120. This, or something similar, is a common device for impeding a
pursuer in European fairy tales.

177. Pohjan eukko. Another epithet for Louhi.

383, 384. The Sampo being not only an unfailing corn, salt, and
money-mill, but a palladium of general prosperity, Pohjola would
naturally fall into famine and misery when nothing remained but an
almost worthless fragment of the cover. It is possible that the story
may refer to some great and permanent change for the worse of the
climate of the North; either during the storms and earthquakes of the
fourteenth century, which would connect it with the plague described in
Runo XLV.; or perhaps to a much earlier period, when, as old Persian
books tell us, the climate of some part of Asia (?) was changed from
nine months summer and three months winter, to nine months winter and
three months summer.


RUNO XLV

41. Loviatar represents the evil and destructive powers of Nature, as
opposed to the beneficent powers, represented in the _Kalevala_ under
the twin aspects of Ilmatar and Marjatta.

117. This speech or invocation is not addressed to Loviatar, but
apparently to some goddess similar to the Roman Lucina.

168. Dr. Russell says that the itch was more dreaded than the plague in
Aleppo in the eighteenth century.

181. Pestilence has often been attributed to the anger of gods or
demons; and Finland suffered severely from plague till well into the
eighteenth century. But I am inclined to regard the plague described
here as the Black Death, which must have ravaged Finland about 1350.

269, 282, 283. All these names have nearly the same significance, and
might be rendered by "Dolores, our Lady of Pain."


RUNO XLVI

13, 14. The pestilence having abated at the approach of winter, the wild
beasts naturally overran the devastated country. So I would interpret
this passage.

25. Literally, three feathers, but the commentary gives the meaning
adopted above.

81. For an account of bear-hunting in Finland, compare Acerbi's _Voyage
to the North Cape_, I., pp. 288, 289.

168. Tapio is the lord of the forest here alluded to, according to the
commentary.

246. The word here rendered "charge" literally means "bundle" or
"package."

313. Probably the Danish Sound.

377. A honeyed forest perhaps means a forest abounding in honey-dew.

565, 566. These lines are rather musical:

Kuuluvilla karjan kellon,
Luona tiukujen tirinän.


RUNO XLVII

15, 16. There is a Finnish ballad relating how the sun and moon were
stolen by German and Esthonian sorcerers, and recovered by the son of
Jumala. (_Kanteletar_, III., 2; translated by Mr. C. J. Billson,
_Folklore_, VI., 343, 344.)

37. Compare the story of Maui stealing the fire in New Zealand legends.

128. Lake Ladoga seems to be intended.

233. Does this refer to tides? Tides can hardly be known in Finland,
except by hearsay; the Baltic itself is almost tideless.


RUNO XLVIII

137, 138. Neptune's trident?

169. Here a different epithet is applied to Väinämöinen.

283. Probably _Polyporus igniarius_ or _P. fomentarius_, both of which
are much used for tinder.

302. He appears to have thought that Panu was in league with the Fire.


RUNO XLIX

83. This is Rhabdomancy, or divination by rods.

417. Literally, at the end of our thumbs.


RUNO L

1. Marjatta korea kuopus.

Literally, Marjatta the elegant darling; an expression occurring nowhere
else in the _Kalevala_. The story in the present Runo seems to exhibit a
veneer of Christianity over Shaman legends. Even the name Marjatta,
notwithstanding its resemblance to Maria, seems to be really derived
from the word marja, a berry. An old writer says that the favourite
deities of the Finns in his time were Väinämöinen and the Virgin Mary.

188. That is, a criminal who deserves to be burnt at the stake.

199, 200. She already recognizes her unborn son as an Avatar.

289. The word here rendered "hapless" properly means "little."

465. This is the only passage in the _Kalevala_ in which Väinämöinen is
spoken of as ever having been young; though he is occasionally called
young in variants.

465-468. This passage apparently alludes to Väinämöinen having sent
Ilmarinen to Pohjola by a trick.

471-474. This must allude either to the fate of Aino, or to some story
not included in the _Kalevala_.

501. In Esthonian legends, Vanemuine is not an Avatar and culture-hero,
but the God of Music, who withdrew from men on account of the ribaldry
with which some of his hearers received his divine songs. (_Hero of
Esthonia_, II., pp. 80-85.) Longfellow also makes Hiawatha depart in a
boat after the conclusion of his mission.

613, 614. These expressions remind us of the Buddha "breaking down the
rafters and the roof-tree" preparatory to reaching Nirvano.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.


1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
