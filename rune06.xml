    <head type="title">WAINAMOINEN’S HAPLESS JOURNEY.</head>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</l>
        <l>Now arranges for a journey</l>
        <l>To the village of the Northland,</l>
        <l>To the land of cruel winters,</l>
        <l>To the land of little sunshine,</l>
        <l>To the land of worthy women;</l>
        <l>Takes his light-foot, royal racer,</l>
        <l>Then adjusts the golden bridle,</l>
        <l>Lays upon his back the saddle,</l>
        <l>Silver-buckled, copper-stirruped,</l>
        <l>Seats himself upon his courser,</l>
        <l>And begins his journey northward;</l>
        <l>Plunges onward, onward, onward,</l>
        <l>Galloping along the highway,</l>
        <l>In his saddle, gaily fashioned,</l>
        <l>On his dappled steed of magic,</l>
        <l>Plunging through Wainola’s meadows,</l>
        <l>O’er the plains of Kalevala.</l>
        <l>Fast and far he galloped onward,</l>
        <l>Galloped far beyond Wainola,</l>
        <l>Bounded o’er the waste of waters,</l>
        <l>Till he reached the blue-sea’s margin,</l>
        <l>Wetting not the hoofs in running.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>But the evil Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Nursed a grudge within his bosom,</l>
        <l>In his heart the worm of envy,</l>
        <l>Envy of this Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Of this wonderful enchanter.</l>
        <l>He prepares a cruel cross-bow,</l>
        <l>Made of steel and other metals,</l>
        <l>Paints the bow in many colors,</l>
        <l>Molds the top-piece out of copper,</l>
        <l>Trims his bow with snowy silver,</l>
        <l>Gold he uses too in trimming.</l>
        <l>Then he hunts for strongest sinews,</l>
        <l>Finds them in the stag of Hisi,</l>
        <l>Interweaves the flax of Lempo.</l>
        <l>Ready is the cruel cross-bow,</l>
        <l>String, and shaft, and ends are finished,</l>
        <l>Beautiful the bow and mighty,</l>
        <l>Surely cost it not a trifle;</l>
        <l>On the back a painted courser,</l>
        <l>On each end a colt of beauty,</l>
        <l>Near the curve a maiden sleeping,</l>
        <l>Near the notch a hare is bounding,</l>
        <l>Wonderful the bow thus fashioned;</l>
        <l>Cuts some arrows for his quiver,</l>
        <l>Covers them with finest feathers,</l>
        <l>From the oak the shafts he fashions,</l>
        <l>Makes the tips of keenest metal.</l>
        <l>As the rods and points are finished,</l>
        <l>Then he feathers well his arrows</l>
        <l>From the plumage of the swallow,</l>
        <l>From the wing-quills of the sparrow;</l>
        <l>Hardens well his feathered arrows,</l>
        <l>And imparts to each new virtues,</l>
        <l>Steeps them in the blood of serpents,</l>
        <l>In the virus of the adder.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Ready now are all his arrows,</l>
        <l>Ready strung, his cruel cross-bow,</l>
        <l>Waiting for wise Wainamoinen.</l>
        <l>Youkahainen, Lapland’s minstrel,</l>
        <l>Waits a long time, is not weary,</l>
        <l>Hopes to spy the ancient singer;</l>
        <l>Spies at day-dawn, spies at evening,</l>
        <l>Spies he ceaselessly at noontide,</l>
        <l>Lies in wait for the magician,</l>
        <l>Waits, and watches, as in envy;</l>
        <l>Sits he at the open window,</l>
        <l>Stands behind the hedge, and watches;</l>
        <l>In the foot-path waits, and listens,</l>
        <l>Spies along the balks of meadows;</l>
        <l>On his back he hangs his quiver,</l>
        <l>In his quiver, feathered arrows</l>
        <l>Dipped in virus of the viper,</l>
        <l>On his arm the mighty cross-bow,</l>
        <l>Waits, and watches, and unwearied,</l>
        <l>Listens from the boat-house window,</l>
        <l>Lingers at the end of Fog-point,</l>
        <l>By the river flowing seaward,</l>
        <l>Near the holy stream and whirlpool,</l>
        <l>Near the sacred river’s fire-fall.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Finally the Lapland minstrel,</l>
        <l>Youkahainen of Pohyola,</l>
        <l>At the breaking of the day-dawn,</l>
        <l>At the early hour of morning,</l>
        <l>Fixed his gaze upon the North-east,</l>
        <l>Turned his eyes upon the sunrise,</l>
        <l>Saw a black cloud on the ocean,</l>
        <l>Something blue upon the waters,</l>
        <l>And soliloquized as follows:</l>
        <l>“Are those clouds on the horizon,</l>
        <l>Or perchance the dawn of morning?</l>
        <l>Neither clouds on the horizon,</l>
        <l>Nor the dawning of the morning;</l>
        <l>It is ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>The renowned and wise enchanter,</l>
        <l>Riding on his way to Northland;</l>
        <l>On his steed, the royal racer,</l>
        <l>Magic courser of Wainola.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Quickly now young Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s vain and evil minstrel,</l>
        <l>Filled with envy, grasps his cross-bow,</l>
        <l>Makes his bow and arrows ready</l>
        <l>For the death of Wainamoinen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Quick his aged mother asked him,</l>
        <l>Spake these words to Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“For whose slaughter is thy cross-bow,</l>
        <l>For whose heart thy poisoned arrows?”</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“I have made this mighty cross-bow,</l>
        <l>Fashioned bow and poisoned arrows</l>
        <l>For the death of Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Thus to slay the friend of waters;</l>
        <l>I must shoot the old magician,</l>
        <l>The eternal bard and hero,</l>
        <l>Through the heart, and through the liver,</l>
        <l>Through the head, and through the shoulders,</l>
        <l>With this bow and feathered arrows</l>
        <l>Thus destroy my rival minstrel.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the aged mother answered,</l>
        <l>Thus reproving, thus forbidding:</l>
        <l>“Do not slay good Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Ancient hero of the Northland,</l>
        <l>From a noble tribe descended,</l>
        <l>He, my sister’s son, my nephew.</l>
        <l>If thou slayest Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Ancient son of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Then alas! all joy will vanish,</l>
        <l>Perish all our wondrous singing;</l>
        <l>Better on the earth the gladness,</l>
        <l>Better here the magic music,</l>
        <l>Than within the nether regions,</l>
        <l>In the kingdom of Tuoni,</l>
        <l>In the realm of the departed,</l>
        <l>In the land of the hereafter.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the youthful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Thought awhile and well considered,</l>
        <l>Ere he made a final answer.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>With one hand he raised the cross-bow</l>
        <l>But the other seemed to weaken,</l>
        <l>As he drew the cruel bow-string.</l>
        <l>Finally these words he uttered</l>
        <l>As his bosom swelled with envy:</l>
        <l>“Let all joy forever vanish,</l>
        <l>Let earth’s pleasures quickly perish,</l>
        <l>Disappear earth’s sweetest music,</l>
        <l>Happiness depart forever;</l>
        <l>Shoot I will this rival minstrel,</l>
        <l>Little heeding what the end is.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Quickly now he bends his fire-bow,</l>
        <l>On his left knee rests the weapon,</l>
        <l>With his right foot firmly planted,</l>
        <l>Thus he strings his bow of envy;</l>
        <l>Takes three arrows from his quiver,</l>
        <l>Choosing well the best among them,</l>
        <l>Carefully adjusts the bow-string,</l>
        <l>Sets with care the feathered arrow,</l>
        <l>To the flaxen string he lays it,</l>
        <l>Holds the cross-bow to his shoulder,</l>
        <l>Aiming well along the margin,</l>
        <l>At the heart of Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Waiting till he gallops nearer;</l>
        <l>In the shadow of a thicket,</l>
        <l>Speaks these words while he is waiting</l>
        <l>“Be thou, flaxen string, elastic;</l>
        <l>Swiftly fly, thou feathered ash-wood,</l>
        <l>Swiftly speed, thou deadly missile,</l>
        <l>Quick as light, thou poisoned arrow,</l>
        <l>To the heart of Wainamoinen.</l>
        <l>If my hand too low should hold thee,</l>
        <l>May the gods direct thee higher;</l>
        <l>If too high mine eye should aim thee,</l>
        <l>May the gods direct thee lower.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Steady now he pulls the trigger;</l>
        <l>Like the lightning flies the arrow</l>
        <l>O’er the head of Wainamoinen;</l>
        <l>To the upper sky it darteth,</l>
        <l>And the highest clouds it pierces,</l>
        <l>Scatters all the flock of lamb-clouds,</l>
        <l>On its rapid journey skyward.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Not discouraged, quick selecting,</l>
        <l>Quick adjusting, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Quickly aiming, shoots a second.</l>
        <l>Speeds the arrow swift as lightning;</l>
        <l>Much too low he aimed the missile,</l>
        <l>Into earth the arrow plunges,</l>
        <l>Pierces to the lower regions,</l>
        <l>Splits in two the old Sand Mountain.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Nothing daunted, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Quick adjusting shoots a third one.</l>
        <l>Swift as light it speeds its journey,</l>
        <l>Strikes the steed of Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Strikes the light-foot, ocean-swimmer,</l>
        <l>Strikes him near his golden girdle,</l>
        <l>Through the shoulder of the racer.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>Headlong fell upon the waters,</l>
        <l>Plunged beneath the rolling billows,</l>
        <l>From the saddle of the courser,</l>
        <l>From his dappled steed of magic.</l>
        <l>Then arose a mighty storm-wind,</l>
        <l>Roaring wildly on the waters,</l>
        <l>Bore away old Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>Far from land upon the billows,</l>
        <l>On the high and rolling billows,</l>
        <l>On the broad sea’s great expanses.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Boasted then young Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Thinking Waino dead and buried,</l>
        <l>These the boastful words he uttered:</l>
        <l>“Nevermore, old Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Nevermore in all thy life-time,</l>
        <l>While the golden moonlight glistens,</l>
        <l>Nevermore wilt fix thy vision</l>
        <l>On the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>On the plains of Kalevala;</l>
        <l>Full six years must swim the ocean,</l>
        <l>Tread the waves for seven summers,</l>
        <l>Eight years ride the foamy billows,</l>
        <l>In the broad expanse of water;</l>
        <l>Six long autumns as a fir-tree,</l>
        <l>Seven winters as a pebble,</l>
        <l>Eight long summers as an aspen.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thereupon the Lapland minstrel</l>
        <l>Hastened to his room delighting,</l>
        <l>When his mother thus addressed him</l>
        <l>“Hast thou slain good Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Slain the son of Kalevala?”</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“I have slain old Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Slain the son of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>That he now may plow the ocean,</l>
        <l>That he now may sweep the waters,</l>
        <l>On the billows rock and slumber.</l>
        <l>In the salt-sea plunged he headlong,</l>
        <l>In the deep sank the magician,</l>
        <l>Sidewise turned he to the sea-shore,</l>
        <l>On his back to rock forever,</l>
        <l>Thus the boundless sea to travel,</l>
        <l>Thus to ride the rolling billows.”</l>
        <l>This the answer of the mother:</l>
        <l>“Woe to earth for this thine action,</l>
        <l>Gone forever, joy and singing,</l>
        <l>Vanished is the wit of ages!</l>
        <l>Thou hast slain good Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Slain the ancient wisdom-singer,</l>
        <l>Slain the pride of Suwantala,</l>
        <l>Slain the hero of Wainola,</l>
        <l>Slain the joy of Kalevala.”</l>
    </lg>
