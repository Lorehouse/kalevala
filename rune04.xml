    <head type="title">THE FATE OF AINO.</head>
    <lg>
        <l>When the night had passed, the maiden,</l>
        <l>Sister fair of Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Hastened early to the forest,</l>
        <l>Birchen shoots for brooms to gather,</l>
        <l>Went to gather birchen tassels;</l>
        <l>Bound a bundle for her father,</l>
        <l>Bound a birch-broom for her mother,</l>
        <l>Silken tassels for her sister.</l>
        <l>Straightway then she hastened homeward,</l>
        <l>By a foot-path left the forest;</l>
        <l>As she neared the woodland border,</l>
        <l>Lo! the ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Quickly spying out the maiden,</l>
        <l>As she left the birchen woodland,</l>
        <l>Trimly dressed in costly raiment,</l>
        <l>And the minstrel thus addressed her:</l>
        <l>“Aino, beauty of the Northland,</l>
        <l>Wear not, lovely maid, for others,</l>
        <l>Only wear for me, sweet maiden,</l>
        <l>Golden cross upon thy bosom,</l>
        <l>Shining pearls upon thy shoulders;</l>
        <l>Bind for me thine auburn tresses,</l>
        <l>Wear for me thy golden braidlets.”</l>
        <l>Thus the maiden quickly answered:</l>
        <l>“Not for thee and not for others,</l>
        <l>Hang I from my neck the crosslet,</l>
        <l>Deck my hair with silken ribbons;</l>
        <l>Need no more the many trinkets</l>
        <l>Brought to me by ship or shallop;</l>
        <l>Sooner wear the simplest raiment,</l>
        <l>Feed upon the barley bread-crust,</l>
        <l>Dwell forever with my mother</l>
        <l>In the cabin with my father.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then she threw the gold cross from her,</l>
        <l>Tore the jewels from her fingers,</l>
        <l>Quickly loosed her shining necklace,</l>
        <l>Quick untied her silken ribbons,</l>
        <l>Cast them all away indignant</l>
        <l>Into forest ferns and flowers.</l>
        <l>Thereupon the maiden, Aino,</l>
        <l>Hastened to her mother’s cottage.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>At the window sat her father</l>
        <l>Whittling on an oaken ax-helve:</l>
        <l>“Wherefore weepest, beauteous Aino,</l>
        <l>Aino, my beloved daughter?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Cause enough for weeping, father,</l>
        <l>Good the reasons for my mourning,</l>
        <l>This, the reason for my weeping,</l>
        <l>This, the cause of all my sorrow:</l>
        <l>From my breast I tore the crosslet,</l>
        <l>From my belt, the clasp of copper,</l>
        <l>From my waist, the belt of silver,</l>
        <l>Golden was my pretty crosslet.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Near the door-way sat her brother,</l>
        <l>Carving out a birchen ox-bow:</l>
        <l>“Why art weeping, lovely Aino,</l>
        <l>Aino, my devoted sister?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Cause enough for weeping, brother,</l>
        <l>Good the reasons for my mourning:</l>
        <l>Therefore come I as thou seest,</l>
        <l>Rings no longer on my fingers,</l>
        <l>On my neck no pretty necklace;</l>
        <l>Golden were the rings thou gavest,</l>
        <l>And the necklace, pearls and silver!”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>On the threshold sat her sister,</l>
        <l>Weaving her a golden girdle:</l>
        <l>“Why art weeping, beauteous Aino,</l>
        <l>Aino, my beloved sister?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Cause enough for weeping, sister,</l>
        <l>Good the reasons for my sorrow:</l>
        <l>Therefore come I as thou seest,</l>
        <l>On my head no scarlet fillet,</l>
        <l>In my hair no braids of silver,</l>
        <l>On mine arms no purple ribbons,</l>
        <l>Round my neck no shining necklace,</l>
        <l>On my breast no golden crosslet,</l>
        <l>In mine ears no golden ear-rings.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Near the door-way of the dairy,</l>
        <l>Skimming cream, sat Aino’s mother.</l>
        <l>“Why art weeping, lovely Aino,</l>
        <l>Aino, my devoted daughter?”</l>
        <l>Thus the sobbing maiden answered:</l>
        <l>“Loving mother, all-forgiving,</l>
        <l>Cause enough for this my weeping,</l>
        <l>Good the reasons for my sorrow,</l>
        <l>Therefore do I weep, dear mother:</l>
        <l>I have been within the forest,</l>
        <l>Brooms to bind and shoots to gather,</l>
        <l>There to pluck some birchen tassels;</l>
        <l>Bound a bundle for my father,</l>
        <l>Bound a second for my mother,</l>
        <l>Bound a third one for my brother,</l>
        <l>For my sister silken tassels.</l>
        <l>Straightway then I hastened homeward,</l>
        <l>By a foot-path left the forest;</l>
        <l>As I reached the woodland border</l>
        <l>Spake Osmoinen from the cornfield,</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>‘Wear not, beauteous maid, for others,</l>
        <l>Only wear for me, sweet maiden,</l>
        <l>On thy breast a golden crosslet,</l>
        <l>Shining pearls upon thy shoulders,</l>
        <l>Bind for me thine auburn tresses,</l>
        <l>Weave for me thy silver braidlets.’</l>
        <l>Then I threw the gold-cross from me,</l>
        <l>Tore the jewels from my fingers,</l>
        <l>Quickly loosed my shining necklace,</l>
        <l>Quick untied my silken ribbons,</l>
        <l>Cast them all away indignant,</l>
        <l>Into forest ferns and flowers.</l>
        <l>Then I thus addressed the singer:</l>
        <l>‘Not for thee and not for others,</l>
        <l>Hang I from my neck the crosslet,</l>
        <l>Deck my hair with silken ribbons;</l>
        <l>Need no more the many trinkets,</l>
        <l>Brought to me by ship and shallop;</l>
        <l>Sooner wear the simplest raiment,</l>
        <l>Feed upon the barley bread-crust,</l>
        <l>Dwell forever with my mother</l>
        <l>In the cabin with my father.’”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus the gray-haired mother answered</l>
        <l>Aino, her beloved daughter:</l>
        <l>“Weep no more, my lovely maiden,</l>
        <l>Waste no more of thy sweet young-life;</l>
        <l>One year eat thou my sweet butter,</l>
        <l>It will make thee strong and ruddy;</l>
        <l>Eat another year fresh bacon,</l>
        <l>It will make thee tall and queenly;</l>
        <l>Eat a third year only dainties,</l>
        <l>It will make thee fair and lovely.</l>
        <l>Now make haste to yonder hill-top,</l>
        <l>To the store-house on the mountain,</l>
        <l>Open there the large compartment,</l>
        <l>Thou will find it filled with boxes,</l>
        <l>Chests and cases, trunks and boxes;</l>
        <l>Open thou the box, the largest,</l>
        <l>Lift away the gaudy cover,</l>
        <l>Thou will find six golden girdles,</l>
        <l>Seven rainbow-tinted dresses,</l>
        <l>Woven by the Moon’s fair daughters,</l>
        <l>Fashioned by the Sun’s sweet virgins.</l>
        <l>In my young years once I wandered,</l>
        <l>As a maiden on the mountains,</l>
        <l>In the happy days of childhood,</l>
        <l>Hunting berries in the coppice;</l>
        <l>There by chance I heard the daughters</l>
        <l>Of the Moon as they were weaving;</l>
        <l>There I also heard the daughters</l>
        <l>Of the Sun as they were spinning</l>
        <l>On the red rims of the cloudlets,</l>
        <l>O’er the blue edge of the forest,</l>
        <l>On the border of the pine-wood,</l>
        <l>On a high and distant mountain.</l>
        <l>I approached them, drawing nearer,</l>
        <l>Stole myself within their hearing,</l>
        <l>Then began I to entreat them,</l>
        <l>Thus besought them, gently pleading:</l>
        <l>‘Give thy silver, Moon’s fair daughters,</l>
        <l>To a poor, but worthy maiden;</l>
        <l>Give thy gold, O Sun’s sweet virgins,</l>
        <l>To this maiden, young and needy.’</l>
        <l>Thereupon the Moon’s fair daughters</l>
        <l>Gave me silver from their coffers;</l>
        <l>And the Sun’s sweet shining virgins</l>
        <l>Gave me gold from their abundance,</l>
        <l>Gold to deck my throbbing temples,</l>
        <l>For my hair the shining silver.</l>
        <l>Then I hastened joyful homeward,</l>
        <l>Richly laden with my treasures,</l>
        <l>Happy to my mother’s cottage;</l>
        <l>Wore them one day, than a second,</l>
        <l>Then a third day also wore them,</l>
        <l>Took the gold then from my temples,</l>
        <l>From my hair I took the silver,</l>
        <l>Careful laid them in their boxes,</l>
        <l>Many seasons have they lain there,</l>
        <l>Have not seen them since my childhood.</l>
        <l>Deck thy brow with silken ribbon,</l>
        <l>Trim with gold thy throbbing temples,</l>
        <l>And thy neck with pearly necklace,</l>
        <l>Hang the gold-cross on thy bosom,</l>
        <l>Robe thyself in pure, white linen</l>
        <l>Spun from flax of finest fiber;</l>
        <l>Wear withal the richest short-frock,</l>
        <l>Fasten it with golden girdle;</l>
        <l>On thy feet, put silken stockings,</l>
        <l>With the shoes of finest leather;</l>
        <l>Deck thy hair with golden braidlets,</l>
        <l>Bind it well with threads of silver;</l>
        <l>Trim with rings thy fairy fingers,</l>
        <l>And thy hands with dainty ruffles;</l>
        <l>Come bedecked then to thy chamber,</l>
        <l>Thus return to this thy household,</l>
        <l>To the greeting of thy kindred,</l>
        <l>To the joy of all that know thee,</l>
        <l>Flushed thy cheeks as ruddy berries,</l>
        <l>Coming as thy father’s sunbeam,</l>
        <l>Walking beautiful and queenly,</l>
        <l>Far more beautiful than moonlight.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus she spake to weeping Aino,</l>
        <l>Thus the mother to her daughter;</l>
        <l>But the maiden, little hearing,</l>
        <l>Does not heed her mother’s wishes;</l>
        <l>Straightway hastens to the court-yard,</l>
        <l>There to weep in bitter sorrow,</l>
        <l>All alone to weep in anguish.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Waiting long the wailing Aino</l>
        <l>Thus at last soliloquizes:</l>
        <l>“Unto what can I now liken</l>
        <l>Happy homes and joys of fortune?</l>
        <l>Like the waters in the river,</l>
        <l>Like the waves in yonder lakelet,</l>
        <l>Like the crystal waters flowing.</l>
        <l>Unto what, the biting sorrow</l>
        <l>Of the child of cold misfortune?</l>
        <l>Like the spirit of the sea-duck,</l>
        <l>Like the icicle in winter,</l>
        <l>Water in the well imprisoned.</l>
        <l>Often roamed my mind in childhood,</l>
        <l>When a maiden free and merry,</l>
        <l>Happily through fen and fallow,</l>
        <l>Gamboled on the meads with lambkins,</l>
        <l>Lingered with the ferns and flowers,</l>
        <l>Knowing neither pain nor trouble;</l>
        <l>Now my mind is filled with sorrow,</l>
        <l>Wanders though the bog and stubble,</l>
        <l>Wanders weary through the brambles,</l>
        <l>Roams throughout the dismal forest,</l>
        <l>Till my life is filled with darkness,</l>
        <l>And my spirit white with anguish.</l>
        <l>Better had it been for Aino</l>
        <l>Had she never seen the sunlight,</l>
        <l>Or if born had died an infant,</l>
        <l>Had not lived to be a maiden</l>
        <l>In these days of sin and sorrow,</l>
        <l>Underneath a star so luckless.</l>
        <l>Better had it been for Aino,</l>
        <l>Had she died upon the eighth day</l>
        <l>After seven nights had vanished;</l>
        <l>Needed then but little linen,</l>
        <l>Needed but a little coffin,</l>
        <l>And a grave of smallest measure;</l>
        <l>Mother would have mourned a little,</l>
        <l>Father too perhaps a trifle,</l>
        <l>Sister would have wept the day through,</l>
        <l>Brother might have shed a tear-drop,</l>
        <l>Thus had ended all the mourning.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus poor Aino wept and murmured,</l>
        <l>Wept one day, and then a second,</l>
        <l>Wept a third from morn till even,</l>
        <l>When again her mother asked her:</l>
        <l>“Why this weeping, fairest daughter,</l>
        <l>Darling daughter, why this grieving?”</l>
        <l>Thus the tearful maiden answered:</l>
        <l>“Therefore do I weep and sorrow,</l>
        <l>Wretched maiden all my life long,</l>
        <l>Since poor Aino, thou hast given,</l>
        <l>Since thy daughter thou hast promised</l>
        <l>To the aged Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Comfort to his years declining,</l>
        <l>Prop to stay him when he totters,</l>
        <l>In the storm a roof above him,</l>
        <l>In his home a cloak around him;</l>
        <l>Better far if thou hadst sent me</l>
        <l>Far below the salt-sea surges,</l>
        <l>To become the whiting’s sister,</l>
        <l>And the friend of perch and salmon;</l>
        <l>Better far to ride the billows,</l>
        <l>Swim the sea-foam as a mermaid,</l>
        <l>And the friend of nimble fishes,</l>
        <l>Than to be an old man’s solace,</l>
        <l>Prop to stay him when he totters,</l>
        <l>Hand to aid him when he trembles,</l>
        <l>Arm to guide him when he falters,</l>
        <l>Strength to give him when he weakens;</l>
        <l>Better be the whiting’s sister</l>
        <l>And the friend of perch and salmon,</l>
        <l>Than an old man’s slave and darling.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Ending thus she left her mother,</l>
        <l>Straightway hastened to the mountain,</l>
        <l>To the store-house on the summit,</l>
        <l>Opened there the box the largest,</l>
        <l>From the box six lids she lifted,</l>
        <l>Found therein six golden girdles,</l>
        <l>Silken dresses seven in number.</l>
        <l>Choosing such as pleased her fancy,</l>
        <l>She adorned herself as bidden,</l>
        <l>Robed herself to look her fairest,</l>
        <l>Gold upon her throbbing temples,</l>
        <l>In her hair the shining silver,</l>
        <l>On her shoulders purple ribbons,</l>
        <l>Band of blue around her forehead,</l>
        <l>Golden cross, and rings, and jewels,</l>
        <l>Fitting ornaments to beauty.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Now she leaves her many treasures,</l>
        <l>Leaves the store-house on the mountain,</l>
        <l>Filled with gold and silver trinkets,</l>
        <l>Wanders over field and meadow,</l>
        <l>Over stone-fields waste and barren,</l>
        <l>Wanders on through fen and forest,</l>
        <l>Through the forest vast and cheerless,</l>
        <l>Wanders hither, wanders thither,</l>
        <l>Singing careless as she wanders,</l>
        <l>This her mournful song and echo:</l>
        <l>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated!</l>
        <l>Woe to Aino, broken-hearted!</l>
        <l>Torture racks my heart and temples,</l>
        <l>Yet the sting would not be deeper,</l>
        <l>Nor the pain and anguish greater,</l>
        <l>If beneath this weight of sorrow,</l>
        <l>In my saddened heart’s dejection,</l>
        <l>I should yield my life forever,</l>
        <l>Now unhappy, I should perish!</l>
        <l>Lo! the time has come for Aino</l>
        <l>From this cruel world to hasten,</l>
        <l>To the kingdom of Tuoni,</l>
        <l>To the realm of the departed,</l>
        <l>To the isle of the hereafter.</l>
        <l>Weep no more for me, O Father,</l>
        <l>Mother dear, withhold thy censure,</l>
        <l>Lovely sister, dry thine eyelids,</l>
        <l>Do not mourn me, dearest brother,</l>
        <l>When I sink beneath the sea-foam,</l>
        <l>Make my home in salmon-grottoes,</l>
        <l>Make my bed in crystal waters,</l>
        <l>Water-ferns my couch and pillow.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>All day long poor Aino wandered,</l>
        <l>All the next day, sad and weary,</l>
        <l>So the third from morn till evening,</l>
        <l>Till the cruel night enwrapped her,</l>
        <l>As she reached the sandy margin,</l>
        <l>Reached the cold and dismal sea-shore,</l>
        <l>Sat upon the rock of sorrow,</l>
        <l>Sat alone in cold and darkness,</l>
        <l>Listened only to the music</l>
        <l>Of the winds and rolling billows,</l>
        <l>Singing all the dirge of Aino.</l>
        <l>All that night the weary maiden</l>
        <l>Wept and wandered on the border</l>
        <l>Through the sand and sea-washed pebbles.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>As the day dawns, looking round her,</l>
        <l>She beholds three water-maidens,</l>
        <l>On a headland jutting seaward,</l>
        <l>Water-maidens four in number,</l>
        <l>Sitting on the wave-lashed ledges,</l>
        <l>Swimming now upon the billows,</l>
        <l>Now upon the rocks reposing.</l>
        <l>Quick the weeping maiden, Aino,</l>
        <l>Hastens there to join the mermaids,</l>
        <l>Fairy maidens of the waters.</l>
        <l>Weeping Aino, now disrobing,</l>
        <l>Lays aside with care her garments,</l>
        <l>Hangs her silk robes on the alders,</l>
        <l>Drops her gold-cross on the sea-shore,</l>
        <l>On the aspen hangs her ribbons,</l>
        <l>On the rocks her silken stockings,</l>
        <l>On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,</l>
        <l>In the sand her shining necklace,</l>
        <l>With her rings and other jewels.</l>

    <lg>
        <l>Out at sea a goodly distance,</l>
        <l>Stood a rock of rainbow colors,</l>
        <l>Glittering in silver sunlight.</l>
        <l>Toward it springs the hapless maiden,</l>
        <l>Thither swims the lovely Aino,</l>
        <l>Up the standing-stone has clambered,</l>
        <l>Wishing there to rest a moment,</l>
        <l>Rest upon the rock of beauty;</l>
        <l>When upon a sudden swaying</l>
        <l>To and fro among the billows,</l>
        <l>With a crash and roar of waters</l>
        <l>Falls the stone of many colors,</l>
        <l>Falls upon the very bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.</l>
        <l>With the stone of rainbow colors,</l>
        <l>Falls the weeping maiden, Aino,</l>
        <l>Clinging to its craggy edges,</l>
        <l>Sinking far below the surface,</l>
        <l>To the bottom of the blue-sea.</l>
        <l>Thus the weeping maiden vanished,</l>
        <l>Thus poor Aino sank and perished,</l>
        <l>Singing as the stone descended,</l>
        <l>Chanting thus as she departed:</l>
        <l>“Once to swim I sought the sea-side,</l>
        <l>There to sport among the billows;</l>
        <l>With the stone of many colors</l>
        <l>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</l>
        <l>Like a pretty son-bird perished.</l>
        <l>Never come a-fishing, father,</l>
        <l>To the borders of these waters,</l>
        <l>Never during all thy life-time,</l>
        <l>As thou lovest daughter Aino.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Mother dear, I sought the sea-side,</l>
        <l>There to sport among the billows;</l>
        <l>With the stone of many colors,</l>
        <l>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</l>
        <l>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</l>
        <l>Never mix thy bread, dear mother,</l>
        <l>With the blue-sea’s foam and waters,</l>
        <l>Never during all thy life-time,</l>
        <l>As thou lovest daughter Aino.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Brother dear, I sought the sea-side,</l>
        <l>There to sport among the billows;</l>
        <l>With the stone of many colors</l>
        <l>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</l>
        <l>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</l>
        <l>Never bring thy prancing war-horse,</l>
        <l>Never bring thy royal racer,</l>
        <l>Never bring thy steeds to water,</l>
        <l>To the borders of the blue-sea,</l>
        <l>Never during all thy life-time,</l>
        <l>As thou lovest sister Aino.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Sister dear, I sought the sea-side,</l>
        <l>There to sport among the billows;</l>
        <l>With the stone of many colors</l>
        <l>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</l>
        <l>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</l>
        <l>Never come to lave thine eyelids</l>
        <l>In this rolling wave and sea-foam,</l>
        <l>Never during all thy life-time,</l>
        <l>As thou lovest sister Aino.</l>
        <l>All the waters in the blue-sea</l>
        <l>Shall be blood of Aino’s body;</l>
        <l>All the fish that swim these waters</l>
        <l>Shall be Aino’s flesh forever;</l>
        <l>All the willows on the sea-side</l>
        <l>Shall be Aino’s ribs hereafter;</l>
        <l>All the sea-grass on the margin</l>
        <l>Will have grown from Aino’s tresses.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus at last the maiden vanished,</l>
        <l>Thus the lovely Aino perished.</l>
        <l>Who will tell the cruel story,</l>
        <l>Who will bear the evil tidings</l>
        <l>To the cottage of her mother,</l>
        <l>Once the home of lovely Aino?</l>
        <l>Will the bear repeat the story,</l>
        <l>Tell the tidings to her mother?</l>
        <l>Nay, the bear must not be herald,</l>
        <l>He would slay the herds of cattle.</l>
        <l>Who then tell the cruel story,</l>
        <l>Who will bear the evil tidings</l>
        <l>To the cottage of her father,</l>
        <l>Once the home of lovely Aino?</l>
        <l>Shall the wolf repeat the story,</l>
        <l>Tell the sad news to her father?</l>
        <l>Nay, the wolf must not be herald,</l>
        <l>He would eat the gentle lambkins.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Who then tell the cruel story,</l>
        <l>Who will bear the evil tidings.</l>
        <l>To the cottage of her sister?</l>
        <l>Will the fox repeat the story</l>
        <l>Tell the tidings to her sister?</l>
        <l>Nay, the fox must not be herald,</l>
        <l>He would eat the ducks and chickens.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Who then tell the cruel story,</l>
        <l>Who will bear the evil tidings</l>
        <l>To the cottage of her brother,</l>
        <l>Once the home of lovely Aino?</l>
        <l>Shall the hare repeat the story,</l>
        <l>Bear the sad news to her brother?</l>
        <l>Yea, the hare shall be the herald,</l>
        <l>Tell to all the cruel story.</l>
        <l>Thus the harmless hare makes answer:</l>
        <l>“I will bear the evil tidings</l>
        <l>To the former home of Aino,</l>
        <l>Tell the story to her kindred.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Swiftly flew the long-eared herald,</l>
        <l>Like the winds he hastened onward,</l>
        <l>Galloped swift as flight of eagles;</l>
        <l>Neck awry he bounded forward</l>
        <l>Till he gained the wished-for cottage,</l>
        <l>Once the home of lovely Aino.</l>
        <l>Silent was the home, and vacant;</l>
        <l>So he hastened to the bath-house,</l>
        <l>Found therein a group of maidens,</l>
        <l>Working each upon a birch-broom.</l>
        <l>Sat the hare upon the threshold,</l>
        <l>And the maidens thus addressed him:</l>
        <l>“Hie there, Long-legs, or we’ll roast thee,</l>
        <l>Hie there, Big-eye, or we’ll stew thee,</l>
        <l>Roast thee for our lady’s breakfast,</l>
        <l>Stew thee for our master’s dinner,</l>
        <l>Make of thee a meal for Aino,</l>
        <l>And her brother, Youkahainen!</l>
        <l>Better therefore thou shouldst gallop</l>
        <l>To thy burrow in the mountains,</l>
        <l>Than be roasted for our dinners.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the haughty hare made answer,</l>
        <l>Chanting thus the fate of Aino:</l>
        <l>“Think ye not I journey hither,</l>
        <l>To be roasted in the skillet,</l>
        <l>To be stewed in yonder kettle;</l>
        <l>Let fell Lempo fill thy tables!</l>
        <l>I have come with evil tidings,</l>
        <l>Come to tell the cruel story</l>
        <l>Of the flight and death of Aino,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen.</l>
        <l>With the stone of many colors</l>
        <l>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless waters,</l>
        <l>Like a pretty song-bird perished;</l>
        <l>Hung her ribbons on the aspen,</l>
        <l>Left her gold-cross on the sea-shore,</l>
        <l>Silken robes upon the alders,</l>
        <l>On the rocks her silken stockings,</l>
        <l>On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,</l>
        <l>In the sand her shining necklace,</l>
        <l>In the sand her rings and jewels;</l>
        <l>In the waves, the lovely Aino,</l>
        <l>Sleeping on the very bottom</l>
        <l>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</l>
        <l>In the caverns of the salmon,</l>
        <l>There to be the whiting’s sister</l>
        <l>And the friend of nimble fishes.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Sadly weeps the ancient mother</l>
        <l>From her blue-eyes bitter tear-drops,</l>
        <l>As in sad and wailing measures,</l>
        <l>Broken-hearted thus she answers:</l>
        <l>“Listen, all ye mothers, listen,</l>
        <l>Learn from me a tale of wisdom:</l>
        <l>Never urge unwilling daughters</l>
        <l>From the dwellings of their fathers,</l>
        <l>To the bridegrooms that they love not,</l>
        <l>Not as I, inhuman mother,</l>
        <l>Drove away my lovely Aino,</l>
        <l>Fairest daughter of the Northland.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Sadly weeps the gray-haired mother,</l>
        <l>And the tears that fall are bitter,</l>
        <l>Flowing down her wrinkled visage,</l>
        <l>Till they trickle on her bosom;</l>
        <l>Then across her heaving bosom,</l>
        <l>Till they reach her garment’s border;</l>
        <l>Then adown her silken stockings,</l>
        <l>Till they touch her shoes of deer-skin;</l>
        <l>Then beneath her shoes of deer-skin,</l>
        <l>Flowing on and flowing ever,</l>
        <l>Part to earth as its possession,</l>
        <l>Part to water as its portion.</l>
        <l>As the tear-drops fall and mingle,</l>
        <l>Form they streamlets three in number,</l>
        <l>And their source, the mother’s eyelids,</l>
        <l>Streamlets formed from pearly tear-drops,</l>
        <l>Flowing on like little rivers,</l>
        <l>And each streamlet larger growing,</l>
        <l>Soon becomes a rushing torrent;</l>
        <l>In each rushing, roaring torrent,</l>
        <l>There a cataract is foaming,</l>
        <l>Foaming in the silver sunlight;</l>
        <l>From the cataract’s commotion</l>
        <l>Rise three pillared rocks in grandeur;</l>
        <l>From each rock, upon the summit,</l>
        <l>Grow three hillocks clothed in verdure;</l>
        <l>From each hillock, speckled birches,</l>
        <l>Three in number, struggle skyward;</l>
        <l>On the summit of each birch-tree</l>
        <l>Sits a golden cuckoo calling,</l>
        <l>And the three sing, all in concord:</l>
        <l>“Love! O Love!” the first one calleth;</l>
        <l>Sings the second, “Suitor! Suitor!”</l>
        <l>And the third one calls and echoes,</l>
        <l>“Consolation! Consolation!”</l>
        <l>He that “Love! O Love!” is calling,</l>
        <l>Calls three moons and calls unceasing,</l>
        <l>For the love-rejecting maiden</l>
        <l>Sleeping in the deep sea-castles.</l>
        <l>He that “Suitor! Suitor!” singeth,</l>
        <l>Sings six moons and sings unceasing</l>
        <l>For the suitor that forever</l>
        <l>Sings and sues without a hearing.</l>
        <l>He that sadly sings and echoes,</l>
        <l>“Consolation! Consolation!”</l>
        <l>Sings unceasing all his life long</l>
        <l>For the broken-hearted mother</l>
        <l>That must mourn and weep forever.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>When the lone and wretched mother</l>
        <l>Heard the sacred cuckoo singing,</l>
        <l>Spake she thus, and sorely weeping:</l>
        <l>“When I hear the cuckoo calling,</l>
        <l>Then my heart is filled with sorrow;</l>
        <l>Tears unlock my heavy eyelids,</l>
        <l>Flow adown my furrowed visage,</l>
        <l>Tears as large as silver sea pearls;</l>
        <l>Older grow my wearied elbows,</l>
        <l>Weaker ply my aged fingers,</l>
        <l>Wearily, in all its members,</l>
        <l>Does my body shake in palsy,</l>
        <l>When I hear the cuckoo singing,</l>
        <l>Hear the sacred cuckoo calling.”</l>
