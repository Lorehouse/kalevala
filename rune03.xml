    <head>WAINAMOINEN AND YOUKAHAINEN.</head>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</l>
        <l>Passed his years in full contentment,</l>
        <l>On the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>On the plains of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Singing ever wondrous legends,</l>
        <l>Songs of ancient wit and wisdom,</l>
        <l>Chanting one day, then a second,</l>
        <l>Singing in the dusk of evening,</l>
        <l>Singing till the dawn of morning,</l>
        <l>Now the tales of old-time heroes,</l>
        <l>Tales of ages long forgotten,</l>
        <l>Now the legends of creation,</l>
        <l>Once familiar to the children,</l>
        <l>By our children sung no longer,</l>
        <l>Sung in part by many heroes,</l>
        <l>In these mournful days of evil,</l>
        <l>Evil days our race befallen.</l>
        <l>Far and wide the story travelled,</l>
        <l>Far away men spread the knowledge</l>
        <l>Of the chanting of the hero,</l>
        <l>Of the song of Wainamoinen;</l>
        <l>To the South were heard the echoes,</l>
        <l>All of Northland heard the story.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Far away in dismal Northland,</l>
        <l>Lived the singer, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s young and reckless minstrel.</l>
        <l>Once upon a time when feasting,</l>
        <l>Dining with his friends and fellows,</l>
        <l>Came upon his ears the story,</l>
        <l>That there lived a sweeter singer,</l>
        <l>On the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>On the plains of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Better skilled in chanting legends,</l>
        <l>Better skilled than Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Better than the one that taught him.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Straightway then the bard grew angry,</l>
        <l>Envy rose within his bosom,</l>
        <l>Envy of this Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Famed to be a sweeter singer;</l>
        <l>Hastes he angry to his mother,</l>
        <l>To his mother, full of wisdom,</l>
        <l>Vows that he will southward hasten,</l>
        <l>Hie him southward and betake him</l>
        <l>To the dwellings of Wainola,</l>
        <l>To the cabins of the Northland,</l>
        <l>There as bard to vie in battle,</l>
        <l>With the famous Wainamoinen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Nay,” replies the anxious father,</l>
        <l>“Do not go to Kalevala.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Nay,” replies the fearful mother,</l>
        <l>“Go not hence to Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>There with him to offer battle;</l>
        <l>He will charm thee with his singing</l>
        <l>Will bewitch thee in his anger,</l>
        <l>He will drive thee back dishonored,</l>
        <l>Sink thee in the fatal snow-drift,</l>
        <l>Turn to ice thy pliant fingers,</l>
        <l>Turn to ice thy feet and ankles.”</l>
        <l>These the words of Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Good the judgement of a father,</l>
        <l>Better still, a mother’s counsel,</l>
        <l>Best of all one’s own decision.</l>
        <l>I will go and face the minstrel,</l>
        <l>Challenge him to sing in contest,</l>
        <l>Challenge him as bard to battle,</l>
        <l>Sing to him my sweet-toned measures,</l>
        <l>Chant to him my oldest legends,</l>
        <l>Chant to him my garnered wisdom,</l>
        <l>That this best of boasted singers,</l>
        <l>That this famous bard of Suomi,</l>
        <l>Shall be worsted in the contest,</l>
        <l>Shall become a hapless minstrel;</l>
        <l>By my songs shall I transform him,</l>
        <l>That his feet shall be as flint-stone,</l>
        <l>And as oak his nether raiment;</l>
        <l>And this famous, best of singers,</l>
        <l>Thus bewitched, shall carry ever,</l>
        <l>In his heart a stony burden,</l>
        <l>On his shoulder bow of marble,</l>
        <l>On his hand a flint-stone gauntlet,</l>
        <l>On his brow a stony visor.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the wizard, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Heeding not advice paternal,</l>
        <l>Heeding not his mother’s counsel,</l>
        <l>Leads his courser from his stable,</l>
        <l>Fire outstreaming from his nostrils,</l>
        <l>From his hoofs, the sparks outshooting,</l>
        <l>Hitches to his sledge, the fleet-foot,</l>
        <l>To his golden sledge, the courser,</l>
        <l>Mounts impetuous his snow-sledge,</l>
        <l>Leaps upon the hindmost cross-bench,</l>
        <l>Strikes his courser with his birch-whip,</l>
        <l>With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled.</l>
        <l>Instantly the prancing racer</l>
        <l>Springs away upon his journey;</l>
        <l>On he, restless, plunges northward,</l>
        <l>All day long he onward gallops,</l>
        <l>All the next day, onward, onward,</l>
        <l>So the third from morn till evening,</l>
        <l>Till the third day twilight brings him</l>
        <l>To the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>To the plains of Kalevala.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>As it happened, Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wainamoinen, the magician,</l>
        <l>Rode that sunset on the highway,</l>
        <l>Silently for pleasure driving</l>
        <l>Down Wainola’s peaceful meadows,</l>
        <l>O’er the plains of Kalevala.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Youkahainen, young and fiery,</l>
        <l>Urging still his foaming courser,</l>
        <l>Dashes down upon the singer,</l>
        <l>Does not turn aside in meeting,</l>
        <l>Meeting thus in full collision;</l>
        <l>Shafts are driven tight together,</l>
        <l>Hames and collars wedged and tangled,</l>
        <l>Tangled are the reins and traces.</l>
        <l>Thus perforce they make a stand-still,</l>
        <l>Thus remain and well consider;</l>
        <l>Water drips from hame and collar,</l>
        <l>Vapors rise from both their horses.</l>
        <l>Speaks the minstrel, Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Who art thou, and whence? Thou comest</l>
        <l>Driving like a stupid stripling,</l>
        <l>Careless, dashing down upon me.</l>
        <l>Thou hast ruined shafts and traces;</l>
        <l>And the collar of my racer</l>
        <l>Thou hast shattered into ruin,</l>
        <l>And my golden sleigh is broken,</l>
        <l>Box and runners dashed to pieces.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Youkahainen then make answer,</l>
        <l>Spake at last the words that follow:</l>
        <l>“I am youthful Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>But make answer first, who thou art,</l>
        <l>Whence thou comest, where thou goest,</l>
        <l>From what lowly tribe descended?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
        <l>Answered thus the youthful minstrel:</l>
        <l>“If thou art but Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Thou shouldst give me all the highway;</l>
        <l>I am many years thy senior.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the boastful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Spake again to Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Young or ancient, little matter,</l>
        <l>Little consequence the age is;</l>
        <l>He that higher stands in wisdom,</l>
        <l>He whose knowledge is the greater,</l>
        <l>He that is the sweeter singer,</l>
        <l>He alone shall keep the highway,</l>
        <l>And the other take the roadside.</l>
        <l>Art thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Famous sorcerer and minstrel?</l>
        <l>Let us then begin our singing,</l>
        <l>Let us sing our ancient legends,</l>
        <l>Let us chant our garnered wisdom,</l>
        <l>That the one may hear the other,</l>
        <l>That the one may judge the other,</l>
        <l>In a war of wizard sayings.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
        <l>Thus replied in modest accents:</l>
        <l>“What I know is very little,</l>
        <l>Hardly is it worth the singing,</l>
        <l>Neither is my singing wondrous:</l>
        <l>All my days I have resided</l>
        <l>In the cold and dreary Northland,</l>
        <l>In a desert land enchanted,</l>
        <l>In my cottage home for ages;</l>
        <l>All the songs that I have gathered,</l>
        <l>Are the cuckoo’s simple measures,</l>
        <l>Some of these I may remember;</l>
        <l>But since thou perforce demandest,</l>
        <l>I accept thy boastful challenge.</l>
        <l>Tell me now, my golden youngster,</l>
        <l>What thou knowest more than others,</l>
        <l>Open now thy store of wisdom.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus made answer Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s young and fiery minstrel:</l>
        <l>“Know I many bits of learning,</l>
        <l>This I know in perfect clearness:</l>
        <l>Every roof must have a chimney,</l>
        <l>Every fire-place have a hearth-stone;</l>
        <l>Lives of seal are free and merry,</l>
        <l>Merry is the life of walrus,</l>
        <l>Feeding on incautious salmon,</l>
        <l>Daily eating perch and whiting;</l>
        <l>Whitings live in quiet shallows,</l>
        <l>Salmon love the level bottoms;</l>
        <l>Spawns the pike in coldest weather,</l>
        <l>And defies the storms of winter.</l>
        <l>Slowly perches swim in Autumn,</l>
        <l>Wry-backed, hunting deeper water,</l>
        <l>Spawn in shallows in the summer,</l>
        <l>Bounding on the shore of ocean.</l>
        <l>Should this wisdom seem too little,</l>
        <l>I can tell thee other matters,</l>
        <l>Sing thee other wizard sayings:</l>
        <l>All the Northmen plow with reindeer,</l>
        <l>Mother-horses plow the Southland,</l>
        <l>Inner Lapland plows with oxen;</l>
        <l>All the trees on Pisa-mountain,</l>
        <l>Know I well in all their grandeur;</l>
        <l>On the Horna-rock are fir-trees,</l>
        <l>Fir-trees growing tall and slender;</l>
        <l>Slender grow the trees on mountains.</l>
        <l>Three, the water-falls in number,</l>
        <l>Three in number, inland oceans,</l>
        <l>Three in number, lofty mountains,</l>
        <l>Shooting to the vault of heaven.</l>
        <l>Hallapyora’s near to Yaemen,</l>
        <l>Katrakoski in Karyala;</l>
        <l>Imatra, the falling water,</l>
        <l>Tumbles, roaring, into Wuoksi.”</l>
        <l>Then the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Women’s tales and children’s wisdom</l>
        <l>Do not please a bearded hero,</l>
        <l>Hero, old enough for wedlock;</l>
        <l>Tell the story of creation,</l>
        <l>Tell me of the world’s beginning,</l>
        <l>Tell me of the creatures in it,</l>
        <l>And philosophize a little.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the youthful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Thus replied to Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Know I well the titmouse-fountains,</l>
        <l>Pretty birdling is the titmouse;</l>
        <l>And the viper, green, a serpent;</l>
        <l>Whitings live in brackish waters;</l>
        <l>Perches swim in every river;</l>
        <l>Iron rusts, and rusting weakens;</l>
        <l>Bitter is the taste of umber;</l>
        <l>Boiling water is malicious;</l>
        <l>Fire is ever full of danger;</l>
        <l>First physician, the Creator;</l>
        <l>Remedy the oldest, water;</l>
        <l>Magic is the child of sea-foam;</l>
        <l>God the first and best adviser;</l>
        <l>Waters gush from every mountain;</l>
        <l>Fire descended first from heaven;</l>
        <l>Iron from the rust was fashioned;</l>
        <l>Copper from the rocks created;</l>
        <l>Marshes are of lands the oldest;</l>
        <l>First of all the trees, the willow;</l>
        <l>Fir-trees were the first of houses;</l>
        <l>Hollowed stones the first of kettles.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Now the ancient Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>Thus addresses Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Canst thou give me now some wisdom,</l>
        <l>Is this nonsense all thou knowest?”</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“I can tell thee still a trifle,</l>
        <l>Tell thee of the times primeval,</l>
        <l>When I plowed the salt-sea’s bosom,</l>
        <l>When I raked the sea-girt islands,</l>
        <l>When I dug the salmon-grottoes,</l>
        <l>Hollowed out the deepest caverns,</l>
        <l>When I all the lakes created,</l>
        <l>When I heaped the mountains round them,</l>
        <l>When I piled the rocks about them.</l>
        <l>I was present as a hero,</l>
        <l>Sixth of wise and ancient heroes,</l>
        <l>Seventh of all primeval heroes,</l>
        <l>When the heavens were created,</l>
        <l>When were formed the ether-spaces,</l>
        <l>When the sky was crystal-pillared,</l>
        <l>When was arched the beauteous rainbow,</l>
        <l>When the Moon was placed in orbit,</l>
        <l>When the silver Sun was planted,</l>
        <l>When the Bear was firmly stationed,</l>
        <l>And with stars the heavens were sprinkled.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Thou art surely prince of liars,</l>
        <l>Lord of all the host of liars;</l>
        <l>Never wert thou in existence,</l>
        <l>Surely wert thou never present,</l>
        <l>When was plowed the salt-sea’s bosom,</l>
        <l>When were raked the sea-girt islands,</l>
        <l>When were dug the salmon-grottoes,</l>
        <l>When were hollowed out the caverns,</l>
        <l>When the lakes were all created,</l>
        <l>When were heaped the mountains round them,</l>
        <l>When the rocks were piled about them.</l>
        <l>Thou wert never seen or heard of</l>
        <l>When the earth was first created,</l>
        <l>When were made the ether-spaces,</l>
        <l>When the air was crystal-pillared,</l>
        <l>When the Moon was placed in orbit,</l>
        <l>When the silver Sun was planted,</l>
        <l>When the Bear was firmly stationed,</l>
        <l>When the skies with stars were sprinkled.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then in anger Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Answered ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Then, sir, since I fail in wisdom,</l>
        <l>With the sword I offer battle;</l>
        <l>Come thou, famous bard and minstrel,</l>
        <l>Thou the ancient wonder-singer,</l>
        <l>Let us try our strength with broadswords,</l>
        <l>Let our blades be fully tested.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Not thy sword and not thy wisdom,</l>
        <l>Not thy prudence, nor thy cunning,</l>
        <l>Do I fear a single moment.</l>
        <l>Let who may accept thy challenge,</l>
        <l>Not with thee, a puny braggart,</l>
        <l>Not with one so vain and paltry,</l>
        <l>Will I ever measure broadswords.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the youthful Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Mouth awry and visage sneering,</l>
        <l>Shook his golden locks and answered:</l>
        <l>“Whoso fears his blade to measure,</l>
        <l>Fears to test his strength at broadswords,</l>
        <l>Into wild-boar of the forest,</l>
        <l>Swine at heart and swine in visage,</l>
        <l>Singing I will thus transform him;</l>
        <l>I will hurl such hero-cowards,</l>
        <l>This one hither, that one thither,</l>
        <l>Stamp him in the mire and bedding,</l>
        <l>In the rubbish of the stable.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Angry then grew Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wrathful waxed, and fiercely frowning,</l>
        <l>Self-composed he broke his silence,</l>
        <l>And began his wondrous singing.</l>
        <l>Sang he not the tales of childhood,</l>
        <l>Children’s nonsense, wit of women,</l>
        <l>Sang he rather bearded heroes,</l>
        <l>That the children never heard of,</l>
        <l>That the boys and maidens knew not,</l>
        <l>Known but half by bride and bridegroom,</l>
        <l>Known in part by many heroes,</l>
        <l>In these mournful days of evil,</l>
        <l>Evil times our race befallen.</l>
        <l>Grandly sang wise Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Till the copper-bearing mountains,</l>
        <l>And the flinty rocks and ledges</l>
        <l>Heard his magic tones and trembled;</l>
        <l>Mountain cliffs were torn to pieces,</l>
        <l>All the ocean heaved and tumbled;</l>
        <l>And the distant hills re-echoed.</l>
        <l>Lo! the boastful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Is transfixed in silent wonder,</l>
        <l>And his sledge with golden trimmings</l>
        <l>Floats like brushwood on the billows;</l>
        <l>Sings his braces into reed-grass,</l>
        <l>Sings his reins to twigs of willow,</l>
        <l>And to shrubs his golden cross-bench.</l>
        <l>Lo! his birch-whip, pearl-enameled,</l>
        <l>Floats a reed upon the border;</l>
        <l>Lo! his steed with golden forehead,</l>
        <l>Stands a statue on the waters;</l>
        <l>Hames and traces are as fir-boughs,</l>
        <l>And his collar, straw and sea-grass.</l>
        <l>Still the minstrel sings enchantment,</l>
        <l>Sings his sword with golden handle,</l>
        <l>Sings it into gleam of lightning,</l>
        <l>Hangs it in the sky above him;</l>
        <l>Sings his cross-bow, gaily painted,</l>
        <l>To a rainbow o’er the ocean;</l>
        <l>Sings his quick and feathered arrows</l>
        <l>Into hawks and screaming eagles;</l>
        <l>Sings his dog with bended muzzle,</l>
        <l>Into block of stone beside him;</l>
        <l>Sings his cap from off his forehead,</l>
        <l>Sings it into wreaths of vapor;</l>
        <l>From his hands he sings his gauntlets</l>
        <l>Into rushes on the waters;</l>
        <l>Sings his vesture, purple-colored,</l>
        <l>Into white clouds in the heavens;</l>
        <l>Sings his girdle, set with jewels,</l>
        <l>Into twinkling stars around him;</l>
        <l>And alas! for Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Sings him into deeps of quick-sand;</l>
        <l>Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,</l>
        <l>In his torture, sinks the wizard,</l>
        <l>To his belt in mud and water.</l>
        <l>Now it was that Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Comprehended but too clearly</l>
        <l>What his folly, what the end was,</l>
        <l>Of the journey he had ventured,</l>
        <l>Vainly he had undertaken</l>
        <l>For the glory of a contest</l>
        <l>With the grand, old Wainamoinen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>When at last young Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Pohyola’s old and sorry stripling,</l>
        <l>Strives his best to move his right foot,</l>
        <l>But alas! the foot obeys not;</l>
        <l>When he strives to move his left foot,</l>
        <l>Lo! he finds it turned to flint-stone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thereupon sad Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>In the deeps of desperation,</l>
        <l>And in earnest supplication,</l>
        <l>Thus addresses Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“O thou wise and worthy minstrel,</l>
        <l>Thou the only true magician,</l>
        <l>Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,</l>
        <l>Only turn away thy magic,</l>
        <l>Let me leave this slough of horror,</l>
        <l>Loose me from this stony prison,</l>
        <l>Free me from this killing torment,</l>
        <l>I will pay a golden ransom.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“What the ransom thou wilt give me</l>
        <l>If I cease from mine enchantment,</l>
        <l>If I turn away my magic,</l>
        <l>Lift thee from thy slough of horror,</l>
        <l>Loose thee from thy stony prison,</l>
        <l>Free thee from thy killing torment?”</l>
        <l>Answered youthful Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Have at home two magic cross-bows,</l>
        <l>Pair of bows of wondrous power,</l>
        <l>One so light a child can bend it,</l>
        <l>Only strength can bend the other,</l>
        <l>Take of these the one that pleases.”</l>
        <l>Then the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Do not wish thy magic cross-bows,</l>
        <l>Have a few of such already,</l>
        <l>Thine to me are worse than useless;</l>
        <l>I have bows in great abundance,</l>
        <l>Bows on every nail and rafter,</l>
        <l>Bows that laugh at all the hunters,</l>
        <l>Bows that go themselves a-hunting.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>Sang alas! poor Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Deeper into mud and water,</l>
        <l>Deeper in the slough of torment.</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“Have at home two magic shallops,</l>
        <l>Beautiful the boats and wondrous;</l>
        <l>One rides light upon the ocean,</l>
        <l>One is made for heavy burdens;</l>
        <l>Take of these the one that pleases.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Do not wish thy magic shallops,</l>
        <l>Have enough of such already;</l>
        <l>All my bays are full of shallops,</l>
        <l>All my shores are lined with shallops,</l>
        <l>Some before the winds are sailors,</l>
        <l>Some were built to sail against them.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Still the minstrel of Wainola</l>
        <l>Sings again poor Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Deeper, deeper into torment,</l>
        <l>Into quicksand to his girdle,</l>
        <l>Till the Lapland bard in anguish</l>
        <l>Speaks again to Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Have at home two magic stallions,</l>
        <l>One a racer, fleet as lightning,</l>
        <l>One was born for heavy burdens;</l>
        <l>Take of these the one that pleases.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Neither do I wish thy stallions,</l>
        <l>Do not need thy hawk-limbed stallions,</l>
        <l>Have enough of these already;</l>
        <l>Magic stallions swarm my stables,</l>
        <l>Eating corn at every manger,</l>
        <l>Broad of back to hold the water,</l>
        <l>Water on each croup in lakelets.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Still the bard of Kalevala</l>
        <l>Sings the hapless Lapland minstrel</l>
        <l>Deeper, deeper into torment,</l>
        <l>To his shoulders into water.</l>
        <l>Spake again young Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Thou the only true magician,</l>
        <l>Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,</l>
        <l>Only turn away thy magic,</l>
        <l>I will give thee gold abundant,</l>
        <l>Countless stores of shining silver;</l>
        <l>From the wars my father brought it,</l>
        <l>Brought it from the hard-fought battles.”</l>
        <l>Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“For thy gold I have no longing,</l>
        <l>Neither do I wish thy silver,</l>
        <l>Have enough of each already;</l>
        <l>Gold abundant fills my chambers,</l>
        <l>On each nail hang bags of silver,</l>
        <l>Gold that glitters in the sunshine,</l>
        <l>Silver shining in the moonlight.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Sank the braggart, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Deeper in his slough of torment,</l>
        <l>To his chin in mud and water,</l>
        <l>Ever praying, thus beseeching:</l>
        <l>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Greatest of the old magicians,</l>
        <l>Lift me from this pit of horror,</l>
        <l>From this prison-house of torture;</l>
        <l>I will give thee all my corn-fields,</l>
        <l>Give thee all my corn in garners,</l>
        <l>Thus my hapless life to ransom,</l>
        <l>Thus to gain eternal freedom.”</l>
        <l>Wainamoinen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“Take thy corn to other markets,</l>
        <l>Give thy garners to the needy;</l>
        <l>I have corn in great abundance,</l>
        <l>Fields have I in every quarter,</l>
        <l>Corn in all my fields is growing;</l>
        <l>One’s own fields are always richer,</l>
        <l>One’s own grain is much the sweeter.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Lapland’s young and reckless minstrel,</l>
        <l>Sorrow-laden, thus enchanted,</l>
        <l>Deeper sinks in mud and water,</l>
        <l>Fear-enchained and full of anguish,</l>
        <l>In the mire, his beard bedrabbled,</l>
        <l>Mouth once boastful filled with sea-weed,</l>
        <l>In the grass his teeth entangled,</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus beseeches:</l>
        <l>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wisest of the wisdom-singers,</l>
        <l>Cease at last thine incantations,</l>
        <l>Only turn away thy magic,</l>
        <l>And my former life restore me,</l>
        <l>Lift me from this stifling torment,</l>
        <l>Free mine eyes from sand and water,</l>
        <l>I will give thee sister, Aino,</l>
        <l>Fairest daughter of my mother,</l>
        <l>Bride of thine to be forever,</l>
        <l>Bride of thine to do thy pleasure,</l>
        <l>Sweep the rooms within thy cottage,</l>
        <l>Keep thy dwelling-place in order,</l>
        <l>Rinse for thee the golden platters,</l>
        <l>Spread thy couch with finest linens,</l>
        <l>For thy bed, weave golden covers,</l>
        <l>Bake for thee the honey-biscuit.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</l>
        <l>Finds at last the wished-for ransom,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s young and fairest daughter,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen;</l>
        <l>Happy he, that he has won him,</l>
        <l>In his age a beauteous maiden,</l>
        <l>Bride of his to be forever,</l>
        <l>Pride and joy of Kalevala.</l>
        <l>Now the happy Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Sits upon the rock of gladness,</l>
        <l>Joyful on the rock of music,</l>
        <l>Sings a little, sings and ceases,</l>
        <l>Sings again, and sings a third time,</l>
        <l>Thus to break the spell of magic,</l>
        <l>Thus to lessen the enchantment,</l>
        <l>Thus the potent charm to banish.</l>
        <l>As the magic spell is broken,</l>
        <l>Youkahainen, sad, but wiser,</l>
        <l>Drags his feet from out the quicksand,</l>
        <l>Lifts his beard from out the water,</l>
        <l>From the rocks leads forth his courser,</l>
        <l>Brings his sledge back from the rushes,</l>
        <l>Calls his whip back from the ocean,</l>
        <l>Sets his golden sledge in order,</l>
        <l>Throws himself upon the cross-bench,</l>
        <l>Snaps his whip and hies him homeward,</l>
        <l>Hastens homeward, heavy-hearted,</l>
        <l>Sad indeed to meet his mother,</l>
        <l>Aino’s mother, gray and aged.</l>
        <l>Careless thus he hastens homeward,</l>
        <l>Nears his home with noise and bustle,</l>
        <l>Reckless drives against the pent-house,</l>
        <l>Breaks the shafts against the portals,</l>
        <l>Breaks his handsome sledge in pieces.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then his mother, quickly guessing,</l>
        <l>Would have chided him for rashness,</l>
        <l>But the father interrupted:</l>
        <l>“Wherefore dost thou break thy snow-sledge,</l>
        <l>Wherefore dash thy thills in fragments,</l>
        <l>Wherefore comest home so strangely,</l>
        <l>Why this rude and wild behavior?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Now alas! poor Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Cap awry upon his forehead,</l>
        <l>Falls to weeping, broken-hearted,</l>
        <l>Head depressed and mind dejected,</l>
        <l>Eyes and lips expressing sadness,</l>
        <l>Answers not his anxious father.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the mother quickly asked him,</l>
        <l>Sought to find his cause for sorrow:</l>
        <l>“Tell me, first-born, why thou weepest,</l>
        <l>Why thou weepest, heavy-hearted,</l>
        <l>Why thy mind is so dejected,</l>
        <l>Why thine eyes express such sadness.”</l>
        <l>Youkahainen then made answer:</l>
        <l>“Golden mother, ever faithful,</l>
        <l>Cause there is to me sufficient,</l>
        <l>Cause enough in what has happened,</l>
        <l>Bitter cause for this my sorrow,</l>
        <l>Cause for bitter tears and murmurs:</l>
        <l>All my days will pass unhappy,</l>
        <l>Since, O mother of my being,</l>
        <l>I have promised beauteous Aino,</l>
        <l>Aino, thy beloved daughter,</l>
        <l>Aino, my devoted sister,</l>
        <l>To decrepit Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Bride to be to him forever,</l>
        <l>Roof above him, prop beneath him,</l>
        <l>Fair companion at his fire-side.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Joyful then arose the mother,</l>
        <l>Clapped her hands in glee together,</l>
        <l>Thus addressing Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Weep no more, my son beloved,</l>
        <l>Thou hast naught to cause thy weeping,</l>
        <l>Hast no reason for thy sorrow,</l>
        <l>Often I this hope have cherished;</l>
        <l>Many years have I been praying</l>
        <l>That this mighty bard and hero,</l>
        <l>Wise and valiant Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Spouse should be to beauteous Aino,</l>
        <l>Son-in-law to me, her mother.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>But the fair and lovely maiden,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Straightway fell to bitter weeping,</l>
        <l>On the threshold wept and lingered,</l>
        <l>Wept all day and all the night long,</l>
        <l>Wept a second, then a third day,</l>
        <l>Wept because a bitter sorrow</l>
        <l>On her youthful heart had fallen.</l>
        <l>Then the gray-haired mother asked her:</l>
        <l>“Why this weeping, lovely Aino?</l>
        <l>Thou hast found a noble suitor,</l>
        <l>Thou wilt rule his spacious dwelling,</l>
        <l>At his window sit and rest thee,</l>
        <l>Rinse betimes his golden platters,</l>
        <l>Walk a queen within his dwelling.”</l>
        <l>Thus replied the tearful Aino:</l>
        <l>“Mother dear, and all-forgiving,</l>
        <l>Cause enough for this my sorrow,</l>
        <l>Cause enough for bitter weeping:</l>
        <l>I must loose my sunny tresses,</l>
        <l>Tresses beautiful and golden,</l>
        <l>Cannot deck my hair with jewels,</l>
        <l>Cannot bind my head with ribbons,</l>
        <l>All to be hereafter hidden</l>
        <l>Underneath the linen bonnet</l>
        <l>That the wife must wear forever;</l>
        <l>Weep at morning, weep at evening,</l>
        <l>Weep alas! for waning beauty,</l>
        <l>Childhood vanished, youth departed,</l>
        <l>Silver sunshine, golden moonlight,</l>
        <l>Hope and pleasure of my childhood,</l>
        <l>Taken from me now forever,</l>
        <l>And so soon to be forgotten</l>
        <l>At the tool-bench of my brother,</l>
        <l>At the window of my sister,</l>
        <l>In the cottage of my father.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Spake again the gray-haired mother</l>
        <l>To her wailing daughter Aino:</l>
        <l>“Cease thy sorrow, foolish maiden,</l>
        <l>By thy tears thou art ungrateful,</l>
        <l>Reason none for thy repining,</l>
        <l>Not the slightest cause for weeping;</l>
        <l>Everywhere the silver sunshine</l>
        <l>Falls as bright on other households;</l>
        <l>Not alone the moonlight glimmers</l>
        <l>Through thy father’s open windows,</l>
        <l>On the work-bench of thy brother;</l>
        <l>Flowers bloom in every meadow,</l>
        <l>Berries grow on every mountain;</l>
        <l>Thou canst go thyself and find them,</l>
        <l>All the day long go and find them;</l>
        <l>Not alone thy brother’s meadows</l>
        <l>Grow the beauteous vines and flowers;</l>
        <l>Not alone thy father’s mountains</l>
        <l>Yield the ripe, nutritious berries;</l>
        <l>Flowers bloom in other meadows,</l>
        <l>Berries grow on other mountains,</l>
        <l>There as here, my lovely Aino.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l><head>WAINAMOINEN AND YOUKAHAINEN.</head></l>
        <l>    </l>
        <l>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</l>
        <l>Passed his years in full contentment,</l>
        <l>On the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>On the plains of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Singing ever wondrous legends,</l>
        <l>Songs of ancient wit and wisdom,</l>
        <l>Chanting one day, then a second,</l>
        <l>Singing in the dusk of evening,</l>
        <l>Singing till the dawn of morning,</l>
        <l>Now the tales of old-time heroes,</l>
        <l>Tales of ages long forgotten,</l>
        <l>Now the legends of creation,</l>
        <l>Once familiar to the children,</l>
        <l>By our children sung no longer,</l>
        <l>Sung in part by many heroes,</l>
        <l>In these mournful days of evil,</l>
        <l>Evil days our race befallen.</l>
        <l>Far and wide the story travelled,</l>
        <l>Far away men spread the knowledge</l>
        <l>Of the chanting of the hero,</l>
        <l>Of the song of Wainamoinen;</l>
        <l>To the South were heard the echoes,</l>
        <l>All of Northland heard the story.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Far away in dismal Northland,</l>
        <l>Lived the singer, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s young and reckless minstrel.</l>
        <l>Once upon a time when feasting,</l>
        <l>Dining with his friends and fellows,</l>
        <l>Came upon his ears the story,</l>
        <l>That there lived a sweeter singer,</l>
        <l>On the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>On the plains of Kalevala,</l>
        <l>Better skilled in chanting legends,</l>
        <l>Better skilled than Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Better than the one that taught him.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Straightway then the bard grew angry,</l>
        <l>Envy rose within his bosom,</l>
        <l>Envy of this Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Famed to be a sweeter singer;</l>
        <l>Hastes he angry to his mother,</l>
        <l>To his mother, full of wisdom,</l>
        <l>Vows that he will southward hasten,</l>
        <l>Hie him southward and betake him</l>
        <l>To the dwellings of Wainola,</l>
        <l>To the cabins of the Northland,</l>
        <l>There as bard to vie in battle,</l>
        <l>With the famous Wainamoinen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Nay,” replies the anxious father,</l>
        <l>“Do not go to Kalevala.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>“Nay,” replies the fearful mother,</l>
        <l>“Go not hence to Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>There with him to offer battle;</l>
        <l>He will charm thee with his singing</l>
        <l>Will bewitch thee in his anger,</l>
        <l>He will drive thee back dishonored,</l>
        <l>Sink thee in the fatal snow-drift,</l>
        <l>Turn to ice thy pliant fingers,</l>
        <l>Turn to ice thy feet and ankles.”</l>
        <l>These the words of Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Good the judgement of a father,</l>
        <l>Better still, a mother’s counsel,</l>
        <l>Best of all one’s own decision.</l>
        <l>I will go and face the minstrel,</l>
        <l>Challenge him to sing in contest,</l>
        <l>Challenge him as bard to battle,</l>
        <l>Sing to him my sweet-toned measures,</l>
        <l>Chant to him my oldest legends,</l>
        <l>Chant to him my garnered wisdom,</l>
        <l>That this best of boasted singers,</l>
        <l>That this famous bard of Suomi,</l>
        <l>Shall be worsted in the contest,</l>
        <l>Shall become a hapless minstrel;</l>
        <l>By my songs shall I transform him,</l>
        <l>That his feet shall be as flint-stone,</l>
        <l>And as oak his nether raiment;</l>
        <l>And this famous, best of singers,</l>
        <l>Thus bewitched, shall carry ever,</l>
        <l>In his heart a stony burden,</l>
        <l>On his shoulder bow of marble,</l>
        <l>On his hand a flint-stone gauntlet,</l>
        <l>On his brow a stony visor.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the wizard, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Heeding not advice paternal,</l>
        <l>Heeding not his mother’s counsel,</l>
        <l>Leads his courser from his stable,</l>
        <l>Fire outstreaming from his nostrils,</l>
        <l>From his hoofs, the sparks outshooting,</l>
        <l>Hitches to his sledge, the fleet-foot,</l>
        <l>To his golden sledge, the courser,</l>
        <l>Mounts impetuous his snow-sledge,</l>
        <l>Leaps upon the hindmost cross-bench,</l>
        <l>Strikes his courser with his birch-whip,</l>
        <l>With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled.</l>
        <l>Instantly the prancing racer</l>
        <l>Springs away upon his journey;</l>
        <l>On he, restless, plunges northward,</l>
        <l>All day long he onward gallops,</l>
        <l>All the next day, onward, onward,</l>
        <l>So the third from morn till evening,</l>
        <l>Till the third day twilight brings him</l>
        <l>To the meadows of Wainola,</l>
        <l>To the plains of Kalevala.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>As it happened, Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wainamoinen, the magician,</l>
        <l>Rode that sunset on the highway,</l>
        <l>Silently for pleasure driving</l>
        <l>Down Wainola’s peaceful meadows,</l>
        <l>O’er the plains of Kalevala.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Youkahainen, young and fiery,</l>
        <l>Urging still his foaming courser,</l>
        <l>Dashes down upon the singer,</l>
        <l>Does not turn aside in meeting,</l>
        <l>Meeting thus in full collision;</l>
        <l>Shafts are driven tight together,</l>
        <l>Hames and collars wedged and tangled,</l>
        <l>Tangled are the reins and traces.</l>
        <l>Thus perforce they make a stand-still,</l>
        <l>Thus remain and well consider;</l>
        <l>Water drips from hame and collar,</l>
        <l>Vapors rise from both their horses.</l>
        <l>Speaks the minstrel, Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Who art thou, and whence? Thou comest</l>
        <l>Driving like a stupid stripling,</l>
        <l>Careless, dashing down upon me.</l>
        <l>Thou hast ruined shafts and traces;</l>
        <l>And the collar of my racer</l>
        <l>Thou hast shattered into ruin,</l>
        <l>And my golden sleigh is broken,</l>
        <l>Box and runners dashed to pieces.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Youkahainen then make answer,</l>
        <l>Spake at last the words that follow:</l>
        <l>“I am youthful Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>But make answer first, who thou art,</l>
        <l>Whence thou comest, where thou goest,</l>
        <l>From what lowly tribe descended?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
        <l>Answered thus the youthful minstrel:</l>
        <l>“If thou art but Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Thou shouldst give me all the highway;</l>
        <l>I am many years thy senior.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the boastful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Spake again to Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Young or ancient, little matter,</l>
        <l>Little consequence the age is;</l>
        <l>He that higher stands in wisdom,</l>
        <l>He whose knowledge is the greater,</l>
        <l>He that is the sweeter singer,</l>
        <l>He alone shall keep the highway,</l>
        <l>And the other take the roadside.</l>
        <l>Art thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Famous sorcerer and minstrel?</l>
        <l>Let us then begin our singing,</l>
        <l>Let us sing our ancient legends,</l>
        <l>Let us chant our garnered wisdom,</l>
        <l>That the one may hear the other,</l>
        <l>That the one may judge the other,</l>
        <l>In a war of wizard sayings.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
        <l>Thus replied in modest accents:</l>
        <l>“What I know is very little,</l>
        <l>Hardly is it worth the singing,</l>
        <l>Neither is my singing wondrous:</l>
        <l>All my days I have resided</l>
        <l>In the cold and dreary Northland,</l>
        <l>In a desert land enchanted,</l>
        <l>In my cottage home for ages;</l>
        <l>All the songs that I have gathered,</l>
        <l>Are the cuckoo’s simple measures,</l>
        <l>Some of these I may remember;</l>
        <l>But since thou perforce demandest,</l>
        <l>I accept thy boastful challenge.</l>
        <l>Tell me now, my golden youngster,</l>
        <l>What thou knowest more than others,</l>
        <l>Open now thy store of wisdom.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thus made answer Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s young and fiery minstrel:</l>
        <l>“Know I many bits of learning,</l>
        <l>This I know in perfect clearness:</l>
        <l>Every roof must have a chimney,</l>
        <l>Every fire-place have a hearth-stone;</l>
        <l>Lives of seal are free and merry,</l>
        <l>Merry is the life of walrus,</l>
        <l>Feeding on incautious salmon,</l>
        <l>Daily eating perch and whiting;</l>
        <l>Whitings live in quiet shallows,</l>
        <l>Salmon love the level bottoms;</l>
        <l>Spawns the pike in coldest weather,</l>
        <l>And defies the storms of winter.</l>
        <l>Slowly perches swim in Autumn,</l>
        <l>Wry-backed, hunting deeper water,</l>
        <l>Spawn in shallows in the summer,</l>
        <l>Bounding on the shore of ocean.</l>
        <l>Should this wisdom seem too little,</l>
        <l>I can tell thee other matters,</l>
        <l>Sing thee other wizard sayings:</l>
        <l>All the Northmen plow with reindeer,</l>
        <l>Mother-horses plow the Southland,</l>
        <l>Inner Lapland plows with oxen;</l>
        <l>All the trees on Pisa-mountain,</l>
        <l>Know I well in all their grandeur;</l>
        <l>On the Horna-rock are fir-trees,</l>
        <l>Fir-trees growing tall and slender;</l>
        <l>Slender grow the trees on mountains.</l>
        <l>Three, the water-falls in number,</l>
        <l>Three in number, inland oceans,</l>
        <l>Three in number, lofty mountains,</l>
        <l>Shooting to the vault of heaven.</l>
        <l>Hallapyora’s near to Yaemen,</l>
        <l>Katrakoski in Karyala;</l>
        <l>Imatra, the falling water,</l>
        <l>Tumbles, roaring, into Wuoksi.”</l>
        <l>Then the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Women’s tales and children’s wisdom</l>
        <l>Do not please a bearded hero,</l>
        <l>Hero, old enough for wedlock;</l>
        <l>Tell the story of creation,</l>
        <l>Tell me of the world’s beginning,</l>
        <l>Tell me of the creatures in it,</l>
        <l>And philosophize a little.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the youthful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Thus replied to Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Know I well the titmouse-fountains,</l>
        <l>Pretty birdling is the titmouse;</l>
        <l>And the viper, green, a serpent;</l>
        <l>Whitings live in brackish waters;</l>
        <l>Perches swim in every river;</l>
        <l>Iron rusts, and rusting weakens;</l>
        <l>Bitter is the taste of umber;</l>
        <l>Boiling water is malicious;</l>
        <l>Fire is ever full of danger;</l>
        <l>First physician, the Creator;</l>
        <l>Remedy the oldest, water;</l>
        <l>Magic is the child of sea-foam;</l>
        <l>God the first and best adviser;</l>
        <l>Waters gush from every mountain;</l>
        <l>Fire descended first from heaven;</l>
        <l>Iron from the rust was fashioned;</l>
        <l>Copper from the rocks created;</l>
        <l>Marshes are of lands the oldest;</l>
        <l>First of all the trees, the willow;</l>
        <l>Fir-trees were the first of houses;</l>
        <l>Hollowed stones the first of kettles.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Now the ancient Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>Thus addresses Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Canst thou give me now some wisdom,</l>
        <l>Is this nonsense all thou knowest?”</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“I can tell thee still a trifle,</l>
        <l>Tell thee of the times primeval,</l>
        <l>When I plowed the salt-sea’s bosom,</l>
        <l>When I raked the sea-girt islands,</l>
        <l>When I dug the salmon-grottoes,</l>
        <l>Hollowed out the deepest caverns,</l>
        <l>When I all the lakes created,</l>
        <l>When I heaped the mountains round them,</l>
        <l>When I piled the rocks about them.</l>
        <l>I was present as a hero,</l>
        <l>Sixth of wise and ancient heroes,</l>
        <l>Seventh of all primeval heroes,</l>
        <l>When the heavens were created,</l>
        <l>When were formed the ether-spaces,</l>
        <l>When the sky was crystal-pillared,</l>
        <l>When was arched the beauteous rainbow,</l>
        <l>When the Moon was placed in orbit,</l>
        <l>When the silver Sun was planted,</l>
        <l>When the Bear was firmly stationed,</l>
        <l>And with stars the heavens were sprinkled.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Thou art surely prince of liars,</l>
        <l>Lord of all the host of liars;</l>
        <l>Never wert thou in existence,</l>
        <l>Surely wert thou never present,</l>
        <l>When was plowed the salt-sea’s bosom,</l>
        <l>When were raked the sea-girt islands,</l>
        <l>When were dug the salmon-grottoes,</l>
        <l>When were hollowed out the caverns,</l>
        <l>When the lakes were all created,</l>
        <l>When were heaped the mountains round them,</l>
        <l>When the rocks were piled about them.</l>
        <l>Thou wert never seen or heard of</l>
        <l>When the earth was first created,</l>
        <l>When were made the ether-spaces,</l>
        <l>When the air was crystal-pillared,</l>
        <l>When the Moon was placed in orbit,</l>
        <l>When the silver Sun was planted,</l>
        <l>When the Bear was firmly stationed,</l>
        <l>When the skies with stars were sprinkled.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then in anger Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Answered ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Then, sir, since I fail in wisdom,</l>
        <l>With the sword I offer battle;</l>
        <l>Come thou, famous bard and minstrel,</l>
        <l>Thou the ancient wonder-singer,</l>
        <l>Let us try our strength with broadswords,</l>
        <l>Let our blades be fully tested.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Not thy sword and not thy wisdom,</l>
        <l>Not thy prudence, nor thy cunning,</l>
        <l>Do I fear a single moment.</l>
        <l>Let who may accept thy challenge,</l>
        <l>Not with thee, a puny braggart,</l>
        <l>Not with one so vain and paltry,</l>
        <l>Will I ever measure broadswords.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the youthful Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Mouth awry and visage sneering,</l>
        <l>Shook his golden locks and answered:</l>
        <l>“Whoso fears his blade to measure,</l>
        <l>Fears to test his strength at broadswords,</l>
        <l>Into wild-boar of the forest,</l>
        <l>Swine at heart and swine in visage,</l>
        <l>Singing I will thus transform him;</l>
        <l>I will hurl such hero-cowards,</l>
        <l>This one hither, that one thither,</l>
        <l>Stamp him in the mire and bedding,</l>
        <l>In the rubbish of the stable.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Angry then grew Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wrathful waxed, and fiercely frowning,</l>
        <l>Self-composed he broke his silence,</l>
        <l>And began his wondrous singing.</l>
        <l>Sang he not the tales of childhood,</l>
        <l>Children’s nonsense, wit of women,</l>
        <l>Sang he rather bearded heroes,</l>
        <l>That the children never heard of,</l>
        <l>That the boys and maidens knew not,</l>
        <l>Known but half by bride and bridegroom,</l>
        <l>Known in part by many heroes,</l>
        <l>In these mournful days of evil,</l>
        <l>Evil times our race befallen.</l>
        <l>Grandly sang wise Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Till the copper-bearing mountains,</l>
        <l>And the flinty rocks and ledges</l>
        <l>Heard his magic tones and trembled;</l>
        <l>Mountain cliffs were torn to pieces,</l>
        <l>All the ocean heaved and tumbled;</l>
        <l>And the distant hills re-echoed.</l>
        <l>Lo! the boastful Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Is transfixed in silent wonder,</l>
        <l>And his sledge with golden trimmings</l>
        <l>Floats like brushwood on the billows;</l>
        <l>Sings his braces into reed-grass,</l>
        <l>Sings his reins to twigs of willow,</l>
        <l>And to shrubs his golden cross-bench.</l>
        <l>Lo! his birch-whip, pearl-enameled,</l>
        <l>Floats a reed upon the border;</l>
        <l>Lo! his steed with golden forehead,</l>
        <l>Stands a statue on the waters;</l>
        <l>Hames and traces are as fir-boughs,</l>
        <l>And his collar, straw and sea-grass.</l>
        <l>Still the minstrel sings enchantment,</l>
        <l>Sings his sword with golden handle,</l>
        <l>Sings it into gleam of lightning,</l>
        <l>Hangs it in the sky above him;</l>
        <l>Sings his cross-bow, gaily painted,</l>
        <l>To a rainbow o’er the ocean;</l>
        <l>Sings his quick and feathered arrows</l>
        <l>Into hawks and screaming eagles;</l>
        <l>Sings his dog with bended muzzle,</l>
        <l>Into block of stone beside him;</l>
        <l>Sings his cap from off his forehead,</l>
        <l>Sings it into wreaths of vapor;</l>
        <l>From his hands he sings his gauntlets</l>
        <l>Into rushes on the waters;</l>
        <l>Sings his vesture, purple-colored,</l>
        <l>Into white clouds in the heavens;</l>
        <l>Sings his girdle, set with jewels,</l>
        <l>Into twinkling stars around him;</l>
        <l>And alas! for Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Sings him into deeps of quick-sand;</l>
        <l>Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,</l>
        <l>In his torture, sinks the wizard,</l>
        <l>To his belt in mud and water.</l>
        <l>Now it was that Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Comprehended but too clearly</l>
        <l>What his folly, what the end was,</l>
        <l>Of the journey he had ventured,</l>
        <l>Vainly he had undertaken</l>
        <l>For the glory of a contest</l>
        <l>With the grand, old Wainamoinen.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>When at last young Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Pohyola’s old and sorry stripling,</l>
        <l>Strives his best to move his right foot,</l>
        <l>But alas! the foot obeys not;</l>
        <l>When he strives to move his left foot,</l>
        <l>Lo! he finds it turned to flint-stone.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Thereupon sad Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>In the deeps of desperation,</l>
        <l>And in earnest supplication,</l>
        <l>Thus addresses Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“O thou wise and worthy minstrel,</l>
        <l>Thou the only true magician,</l>
        <l>Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,</l>
        <l>Only turn away thy magic,</l>
        <l>Let me leave this slough of horror,</l>
        <l>Loose me from this stony prison,</l>
        <l>Free me from this killing torment,</l>
        <l>I will pay a golden ransom.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“What the ransom thou wilt give me</l>
        <l>If I cease from mine enchantment,</l>
        <l>If I turn away my magic,</l>
        <l>Lift thee from thy slough of horror,</l>
        <l>Loose thee from thy stony prison,</l>
        <l>Free thee from thy killing torment?”</l>
        <l>Answered youthful Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Have at home two magic cross-bows,</l>
        <l>Pair of bows of wondrous power,</l>
        <l>One so light a child can bend it,</l>
        <l>Only strength can bend the other,</l>
        <l>Take of these the one that pleases.”</l>
        <l>Then the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Do not wish thy magic cross-bows,</l>
        <l>Have a few of such already,</l>
        <l>Thine to me are worse than useless;</l>
        <l>I have bows in great abundance,</l>
        <l>Bows on every nail and rafter,</l>
        <l>Bows that laugh at all the hunters,</l>
        <l>Bows that go themselves a-hunting.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</l>
        <l>Sang alas! poor Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Deeper into mud and water,</l>
        <l>Deeper in the slough of torment.</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“Have at home two magic shallops,</l>
        <l>Beautiful the boats and wondrous;</l>
        <l>One rides light upon the ocean,</l>
        <l>One is made for heavy burdens;</l>
        <l>Take of these the one that pleases.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Do not wish thy magic shallops,</l>
        <l>Have enough of such already;</l>
        <l>All my bays are full of shallops,</l>
        <l>All my shores are lined with shallops,</l>
        <l>Some before the winds are sailors,</l>
        <l>Some were built to sail against them.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Still the minstrel of Wainola</l>
        <l>Sings again poor Youkahainen</l>
        <l>Deeper, deeper into torment,</l>
        <l>Into quicksand to his girdle,</l>
        <l>Till the Lapland bard in anguish</l>
        <l>Speaks again to Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Have at home two magic stallions,</l>
        <l>One a racer, fleet as lightning,</l>
        <l>One was born for heavy burdens;</l>
        <l>Take of these the one that pleases.”</l>
        <l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“Neither do I wish thy stallions,</l>
        <l>Do not need thy hawk-limbed stallions,</l>
        <l>Have enough of these already;</l>
        <l>Magic stallions swarm my stables,</l>
        <l>Eating corn at every manger,</l>
        <l>Broad of back to hold the water,</l>
        <l>Water on each croup in lakelets.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Still the bard of Kalevala</l>
        <l>Sings the hapless Lapland minstrel</l>
        <l>Deeper, deeper into torment,</l>
        <l>To his shoulders into water.</l>
        <l>Spake again young Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Thou the only true magician,</l>
        <l>Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,</l>
        <l>Only turn away thy magic,</l>
        <l>I will give thee gold abundant,</l>
        <l>Countless stores of shining silver;</l>
        <l>From the wars my father brought it,</l>
        <l>Brought it from the hard-fought battles.”</l>
        <l>Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:</l>
        <l>“For thy gold I have no longing,</l>
        <l>Neither do I wish thy silver,</l>
        <l>Have enough of each already;</l>
        <l>Gold abundant fills my chambers,</l>
        <l>On each nail hang bags of silver,</l>
        <l>Gold that glitters in the sunshine,</l>
        <l>Silver shining in the moonlight.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Sank the braggart, Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Deeper in his slough of torment,</l>
        <l>To his chin in mud and water,</l>
        <l>Ever praying, thus beseeching:</l>
        <l>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Greatest of the old magicians,</l>
        <l>Lift me from this pit of horror,</l>
        <l>From this prison-house of torture;</l>
        <l>I will give thee all my corn-fields,</l>
        <l>Give thee all my corn in garners,</l>
        <l>Thus my hapless life to ransom,</l>
        <l>Thus to gain eternal freedom.”</l>
        <l>Wainamoinen thus made answer:</l>
        <l>“Take thy corn to other markets,</l>
        <l>Give thy garners to the needy;</l>
        <l>I have corn in great abundance,</l>
        <l>Fields have I in every quarter,</l>
        <l>Corn in all my fields is growing;</l>
        <l>One’s own fields are always richer,</l>
        <l>One’s own grain is much the sweeter.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Lapland’s young and reckless minstrel,</l>
        <l>Sorrow-laden, thus enchanted,</l>
        <l>Deeper sinks in mud and water,</l>
        <l>Fear-enchained and full of anguish,</l>
        <l>In the mire, his beard bedrabbled,</l>
        <l>Mouth once boastful filled with sea-weed,</l>
        <l>In the grass his teeth entangled,</l>
        <l>Youkahainen thus beseeches:</l>
        <l>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Wisest of the wisdom-singers,</l>
        <l>Cease at last thine incantations,</l>
        <l>Only turn away thy magic,</l>
        <l>And my former life restore me,</l>
        <l>Lift me from this stifling torment,</l>
        <l>Free mine eyes from sand and water,</l>
        <l>I will give thee sister, Aino,</l>
        <l>Fairest daughter of my mother,</l>
        <l>Bride of thine to be forever,</l>
        <l>Bride of thine to do thy pleasure,</l>
        <l>Sweep the rooms within thy cottage,</l>
        <l>Keep thy dwelling-place in order,</l>
        <l>Rinse for thee the golden platters,</l>
        <l>Spread thy couch with finest linens,</l>
        <l>For thy bed, weave golden covers,</l>
        <l>Bake for thee the honey-biscuit.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</l>
        <l>Finds at last the wished-for ransom,</l>
        <l>Lapland’s young and fairest daughter,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen;</l>
        <l>Happy he, that he has won him,</l>
        <l>In his age a beauteous maiden,</l>
        <l>Bride of his to be forever,</l>
        <l>Pride and joy of Kalevala.</l>
        <l>Now the happy Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Sits upon the rock of gladness,</l>
        <l>Joyful on the rock of music,</l>
        <l>Sings a little, sings and ceases,</l>
        <l>Sings again, and sings a third time,</l>
        <l>Thus to break the spell of magic,</l>
        <l>Thus to lessen the enchantment,</l>
        <l>Thus the potent charm to banish.</l>
        <l>As the magic spell is broken,</l>
        <l>Youkahainen, sad, but wiser,</l>
        <l>Drags his feet from out the quicksand,</l>
        <l>Lifts his beard from out the water,</l>
        <l>From the rocks leads forth his courser,</l>
        <l>Brings his sledge back from the rushes,</l>
        <l>Calls his whip back from the ocean,</l>
        <l>Sets his golden sledge in order,</l>
        <l>Throws himself upon the cross-bench,</l>
        <l>Snaps his whip and hies him homeward,</l>
        <l>Hastens homeward, heavy-hearted,</l>
        <l>Sad indeed to meet his mother,</l>
        <l>Aino’s mother, gray and aged.</l>
        <l>Careless thus he hastens homeward,</l>
        <l>Nears his home with noise and bustle,</l>
        <l>Reckless drives against the pent-house,</l>
        <l>Breaks the shafts against the portals,</l>
        <l>Breaks his handsome sledge in pieces.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then his mother, quickly guessing,</l>
        <l>Would have chided him for rashness,</l>
        <l>But the father interrupted:</l>
        <l>“Wherefore dost thou break thy snow-sledge,</l>
        <l>Wherefore dash thy thills in fragments,</l>
        <l>Wherefore comest home so strangely,</l>
        <l>Why this rude and wild behavior?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Now alas! poor Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Cap awry upon his forehead,</l>
        <l>Falls to weeping, broken-hearted,</l>
        <l>Head depressed and mind dejected,</l>
        <l>Eyes and lips expressing sadness,</l>
        <l>Answers not his anxious father.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Then the mother quickly asked him,</l>
        <l>Sought to find his cause for sorrow:</l>
        <l>“Tell me, first-born, why thou weepest,</l>
        <l>Why thou weepest, heavy-hearted,</l>
        <l>Why thy mind is so dejected,</l>
        <l>Why thine eyes express such sadness.”</l>
        <l>Youkahainen then made answer:</l>
        <l>“Golden mother, ever faithful,</l>
        <l>Cause there is to me sufficient,</l>
        <l>Cause enough in what has happened,</l>
        <l>Bitter cause for this my sorrow,</l>
        <l>Cause for bitter tears and murmurs:</l>
        <l>All my days will pass unhappy,</l>
        <l>Since, O mother of my being,</l>
        <l>I have promised beauteous Aino,</l>
        <l>Aino, thy beloved daughter,</l>
        <l>Aino, my devoted sister,</l>
        <l>To decrepit Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Bride to be to him forever,</l>
        <l>Roof above him, prop beneath him,</l>
        <l>Fair companion at his fire-side.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Joyful then arose the mother,</l>
        <l>Clapped her hands in glee together,</l>
        <l>Thus addressing Youkahainen:</l>
        <l>“Weep no more, my son beloved,</l>
        <l>Thou hast naught to cause thy weeping,</l>
        <l>Hast no reason for thy sorrow,</l>
        <l>Often I this hope have cherished;</l>
        <l>Many years have I been praying</l>
        <l>That this mighty bard and hero,</l>
        <l>Wise and valiant Wainamoinen,</l>
        <l>Spouse should be to beauteous Aino,</l>
        <l>Son-in-law to me, her mother.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>But the fair and lovely maiden,</l>
        <l>Sister dear of Youkahainen,</l>
        <l>Straightway fell to bitter weeping,</l>
        <l>On the threshold wept and lingered,</l>
        <l>Wept all day and all the night long,</l>
        <l>Wept a second, then a third day,</l>
        <l>Wept because a bitter sorrow</l>
        <l>On her youthful heart had fallen.</l>
        <l>Then the gray-haired mother asked her:</l>
        <l>“Why this weeping, lovely Aino?</l>
        <l>Thou hast found a noble suitor,</l>
        <l>Thou wilt rule his spacious dwelling,</l>
        <l>At his window sit and rest thee,</l>
        <l>Rinse betimes his golden platters,</l>
        <l>Walk a queen within his dwelling.”</l>
        <l>Thus replied the tearful Aino:</l>
        <l>“Mother dear, and all-forgiving,</l>
        <l>Cause enough for this my sorrow,</l>
        <l>Cause enough for bitter weeping:</l>
        <l>I must loose my sunny tresses,</l>
        <l>Tresses beautiful and golden,</l>
        <l>Cannot deck my hair with jewels,</l>
        <l>Cannot bind my head with ribbons,</l>
        <l>All to be hereafter hidden</l>
        <l>Underneath the linen bonnet</l>
        <l>That the wife must wear forever;</l>
        <l>Weep at morning, weep at evening,</l>
        <l>Weep alas! for waning beauty,</l>
        <l>Childhood vanished, youth departed,</l>
        <l>Silver sunshine, golden moonlight,</l>
        <l>Hope and pleasure of my childhood,</l>
        <l>Taken from me now forever,</l>
        <l>And so soon to be forgotten</l>
        <l>At the tool-bench of my brother,</l>
        <l>At the window of my sister,</l>
        <l>In the cottage of my father.”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>Spake again the gray-haired mother</l>
        <l>To her wailing daughter Aino:</l>
        <l>“Cease thy sorrow, foolish maiden,</l>
        <l>By thy tears thou art ungrateful,</l>
        <l>Reason none for thy repining,</l>
        <l>Not the slightest cause for weeping;</l>
        <l>Everywhere the silver sunshine</l>
        <l>Falls as bright on other households;</l>
        <l>Not alone the moonlight glimmers</l>
        <l>Through thy father’s open windows,</l>
        <l>On the work-bench of thy brother;</l>
        <l>Flowers bloom in every meadow,</l>
        <l>Berries grow on every mountain;</l>
        <l>Thou canst go thyself and find them,</l>
        <l>All the day long go and find them;</l>
        <l>Not alone thy brother’s meadows</l>
        <l>Grow the beauteous vines and flowers;</l>
        <l>Not alone thy father’s mountains</l>
        <l>Yield the ripe, nutritious berries;</l>
        <l>Flowers bloom in other meadows,</l>
        <l>Berries grow on other mountains,</l>
        <l>There as here, my lovely Aino.”</l>
