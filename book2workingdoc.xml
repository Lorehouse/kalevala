<head>LEMMINKAINEN'S JOURNEY TO POHJOLA</head>
<div type="argument">
Lemminkainen, greatly offended that he was not invited to the wedding, resolves to go to Pohjola, although his mother dissuades him from it, and warns him of the many dangers that he will have to encounter (1-382). He sets forth and succeeds in passing all the dangerous places by his skill in magic (383-776).

<lg>
<l n="26.001">Ahti dwelt upon an island,</l>
<l n="26.002">By the bay near Kauko's headland,</l>
<l n="26.003">And his fields he tilled industrious,</l>
<l n="26.004">And the fields he trenched with ploughing,</l>
<l n="26.005">And his ears were of the finest,</l>
<l n="26.006">And his hearing of the keenest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.007">Heard he shouting in the village,</l>
<l n="26.008">From the lake came sounds of hammering,</l>
<l n="26.009">On the ice the sound of footsteps,</l>
<l n="26.010">On the heath a sledge was rattling,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="26.011">Therefore in his mind he fancied,</l>
<l n="26.012">In his brain the notion entered,</l>
<l n="26.013">That at Pohjola was wedding,</l>
<l n="26.014">And a drinking-bout in secret.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.015">Mouth and head awry then twisting,</l>
<l n="26.016">And his black beard all disordered,</l>
<l n="26.017">In his rage the blood departed</l>
<l n="26.018">From the cheeks of him unhappy,</l>
<l n="26.019">And at once he left his ploughing,</l>
<l n="26.020">'Mid the field he left the ploughshare,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="26.021">On the spot his horse he mounted,</l>
<l n="26.022">And he rode directly homeward,</l>
<l n="26.023">To his dearest mother's dwelling,</l>
<l n="26.024">To his dear and aged mother.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.025">And he said as he approached her,</l>
<l n="26.026">And he called, as he was coming,</l>
<l n="26.027">"O my mother, aged woman,</l>
<l n="26.028">Bring thou food, and bring it quickly,</l>
<l n="26.029">That the hungry man may eat it,</l>
<l n="26.030">And the moody man devour it,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="26.031">While they warm the bathroom for me,</l>
<l n="26.032">And the bathroom set in order,</l>
<l n="26.033">That the man may wash and cleanse him,</l>
<l n="26.034">And adorn him like a hero.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.035">Then did Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="26.036">Bring him food, and bring it quickly,</l>
<l n="26.037">That the hungry man might eat it,</l>
<l n="26.038">And the moody man devour it,</l>
<l n="26.039">While they put the bath in order,</l>
<l n="26.040">And arranged the bathroom for him.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.041">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.042">Quickly ate the food she gave him,</l>
<l n="26.043">Hurried then into the bathroom,</l>
<l n="26.044">Hastened quickly to the bathroom,</l>
<l n="26.045">There it was the finch now washed him,</l>
<l n="26.046">There the bullfinch washed and cleansed him,</l>
<l n="26.047">Washed his head to flaxen whiteness,</l>
<l n="26.048">And his throat to shining whiteness.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.049">From the bath the room he entered,</l>
<l n="26.050">And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="26.051">"O my mother, aged woman,</l>
<l n="26.052">Seek the storehouse on the mountain,</l>
<l n="26.053">Bring me thence my shirt, the fine one,</l>
<l n="26.054">Likewise bring the finest clothing,</l>
<l n="26.055">That I now may put it on me,</l>
<l n="26.056">And may fitly clothe me in it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.057">But his mother asked him quickly,</l>
<l n="26.058">Asked him thus, the aged woman,</l>
<l n="26.059">"Whither goes my son, my dearest,</l>
<l n="26.060">Dost thou go to hunt the lynxes,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="26.061">Or to chase the elk on snowshoes,</l>
<l n="26.062">Or perchance to shoot a squirrel?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.063">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.064">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.065">"O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="26.066">Not to hunt the lynx I wander,</l>
<l n="26.067">Nor to chase the elk on snowshoes,</l>
<l n="26.068">Neither go I squirrel shooting,</l>
<l n="26.069">But I seek the feast at Pohja,</l>
<l n="26.070">And the secret drinking-party,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="26.071">Therefore fetch my shirt, the fine one,</l>
<l n="26.072">Bring me, too, the finest clothing,</l>
<l n="26.073">That I hasten to the wedding,</l>
<l n="26.074">And may wander to the banquet.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.075">But his mother would forbid him,</l>
<l n="26.076">Vainly would his wife dissuade him,</l>
<l n="26.077">Two, whose like were not created,</l>
<l n="26.078">And three daughters of Creation,</l>
<l n="26.079">Sought to hold back Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.080">Back from Pohjola's great banquet.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.081">To her son then said the mother,</l>
<l n="26.082">And her child advised the old one,</l>
<l n="26.083">"Do not go, my son my dearest,</l>
<l n="26.084">O my dearest son, my Kauko,</l>
<l n="26.085">Go not to the feast at Pohja,</l>
<l n="26.086">To that mansion's drinking-party,</l>
<l n="26.087">For indeed they did not ask you,</l>
<l n="26.088">And 'tis plain they do not want you.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.089">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.090">Answered in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="26.091">"Only bad men go for asking;</l>
<l n="26.092">Uninvited good men dance there.</l>
<l n="26.093">There are always invitations,</l>
<l n="26.094">Always a sufficient summons,</l>
<l n="26.095">In the sword with blade of sharpness,</l>
<l n="26.096">And the edge so brightly flashing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.097">Still did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="26.098">Do her utmost to restrain him.</l>
<l n="26.099">"Go not, son, to sure destruction,</l>
<l n="26.100">Unto Pohjola's great banquet.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="26.101">Full of terrors is thy journey,</l>
<l n="26.102">On thy way are mighty wonders,</l>
<l n="26.103">Thrice indeed doth death await thee;</l>
<l n="26.104">Thrice the man with death is threatened.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.105">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.106">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.107">"Death is only for the women,</l>
<l n="26.108">Everywhere they see destruction;</l>
<l n="26.109">But a hero need not fear it,</l>
<l n="26.110">Nor need take extreme precautions.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="26.111">But let this be as it may be,</l>
<l n="26.112">Tell me that my ears may hear it,</l>
<l n="26.113">Tell me the first death that waits me,</l>
<l n="26.114">Tell the first and tell the last one.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.115">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="26.116">Answered then, the aged woman:</l>
<l n="26.117">"I will tell the deaths that wait you,</l>
<l n="26.118">Not as you would have me tell them;</l>
<l n="26.119">Of the first death I will tell you,</l>
<l n="26.120">And this death is first among them.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="26.121">When a little way you've travelled</l>
<l n="26.122">On the first day of your journey,</l>
<l n="26.123">You will reach a fiery river,</l>
<l n="26.124">Flaming right across your pathway,</l>
<l n="26.125">In the stream a cataract fiery,</l>
<l n="26.126">In the fall a fiery island,</l>
<l n="26.127">On the isle a peak all fiery,</l>
<l n="26.128">On the peak a fiery eagle,</l>
<l n="26.129">One who whets his beak at night-time,</l>
<l n="26.130">And his claws in daytime sharpens,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="26.131">For the strangers who are coming,</l>
<l n="26.132">And the people who approach him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.133">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.134">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.135">"This is perhaps a death for women,</l>
<l n="26.136">But 'tis not a death for heroes.</l>
<l n="26.137">For I know a plan already,</l>
<l n="26.138">And a splendid scheme to follow.</l>
<l n="26.139">I'll create, by songs of magic,</l>
<l n="26.140">Both a man and horse of alder.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="26.141">They shall walk along beside me,</l>
<l n="26.142">And shall wander on before me,</l>
<l n="26.143">While I like a duck am diving,</l>
<l n="26.144">Like a scoter duck am diving,</l>
<l n="26.145">'Neath the soaring eagle's talons,</l>
<l n="26.146">Talons of the mighty eagle.</l>
<l n="26.147">O my mother, who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="26.148">Tell me now of death the second.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.149">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="26.150">"Such the second death that waits you:</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="26.151">When a little way you've journeyed,</l>
<l n="26.152">On the second day of travel,</l>
<l n="26.153">You will reach a trench of fire,</l>
<l n="26.154">Right across the path extending,</l>
<l n="26.155">Ever to the east extending,</l>
<l n="26.156">North-west endlessly extending,</l>
<l n="26.157">Full of stones to redness heated,</l>
<l n="26.158">Full of blocks of stone all glowing,</l>
<l n="26.159">And a hundred there have ventured,</l>
<l n="26.160">And a thousand there have perished,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="26.161">Hundreds with their swords have perished,</l>
<l n="26.162">And a thousand steel-clad heroes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.163">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.164">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.165">"Such a death no man will perish,</l>
<l n="26.166">Nor is this a death for heroes,</l>
<l n="26.167">For I know a trick already,</l>
<l n="26.168">Know a trick, and see a refuge;</l>
<l n="26.169">And a man of snow I'll sing me,</l>
<l n="26.170">Make of frozen snow a hero,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="26.171">Push him in the raging fire,</l>
<l n="26.172">Push him in the glowing torment,</l>
<l n="26.173">Bathe him in the glowing bathroom,</l>
<l n="26.174">With a bath-whisk made of copper,</l>
<l n="26.175">I myself behind him pressing,</l>
<l n="26.176">Pushing through the fire a pathway,</l>
<l n="26.177">That my beard unburnt remaineth,</l>
<l n="26.178">And my locks escape a singeing.</l>
<l n="26.179">O my mother who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="26.180">Of the third death tell me truly."</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.181">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="26.182">"Such the third death that awaits you:</l>
<l n="26.183">When you've gone a little further,</l>
<l n="26.184">And another day have travelled,</l>
<l n="26.185">Unto Pohjola's dread gateway,</l>
<l n="26.186">Where the pathway is the narrowest,</l>
<l n="26.187">Then a wolf will rush upon you,</l>
<l n="26.188">And a bear for his companion,</l>
<l n="26.189">There in Pohjola's dread gateway,</l>
<l n="26.190">Where the pathway is the narrowest.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="26.191">Hundreds have been there devoured,</l>
<l n="26.192">Heroes have by thousands perished;</l>
<l n="26.193">Wherefore should they not devour thee,</l>
<l n="26.194">Kill thee likewise, unprotected?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.195">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.196">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.197">"Perhaps a young ewe might be eaten,</l>
<l n="26.198">Or a lamb be torn to pieces,</l>
<l n="26.199">Not a man, how weak soever,</l>
<l n="26.200">Not the sleepiest of the heroes!</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="26.201">With a hero's belt I'm girded,</l>
<l n="26.202">And I wear a hero's armour,</l>
<l n="26.203">Fixed with buckles of a hero,</l>
<l n="26.204">So be sure I shall not hasten,</l>
<l n="26.205">Unto Untamo's dread wolf's jaws,</l>
<l n="26.206">In the throat of that curst creature.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.207">"'Gainst the wolf I know a refuge,</l>
<l n="26.208">'Gainst the bear I know a method;</l>
<l n="26.209">For the wolfs mouth sing a muzzle,</l>
<l n="26.210">For the bear sing iron fetters,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="26.211">Or to very chaff will chop them,</l>
<l n="26.212">Or to merest dust will sift them;</l>
<l n="26.213">Thus I'll clear the path before me,</l>
<l n="26.214">Reach the ending of my journey.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.215">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="26.216">"Even yet your goal you reach not,</l>
<l n="26.217">There are still upon your pathway,</l>
<l n="26.218">On your road tremendous marvels.</l>
<l n="26.219">Three terrific dangers wait you,</l>
<l n="26.220">Three more deaths await the hero;</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="26.221">And there even yet await you,</l>
<l n="26.222">On the spot the worst of marvels.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.223">"When a little way you've travelled,</l>
<l n="26.224">Up to Pohjola's enclosure,</l>
<l n="26.225">There a fence is reared of iron,</l>
<l n="26.226">And a fence of steel erected,</l>
<l n="26.227">From the ground to heaven ascending,</l>
<l n="26.228">From the heavens to earth descending.</l>
<l n="26.229">Spears they are which form the hedgestakes,</l>
<l n="26.230">And for wattles, creeping serpents,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="26.231">Thus the fence with snakes is wattled,</l>
<l n="26.232">And among them there are lizards,</l>
<l n="26.233">And their tails are always waving,</l>
<l n="26.234">And their thick heads always swelling,</l>
<l n="26.235">And their round heads always hissing,</l>
<l n="26.236">Heads turned out, and tails turned inwards.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.237">"On the ground are other serpents,</l>
<l n="26.238">On the path are snakes and adders,</l>
<l n="26.239">And above, their tongues are hissing,</l>
<l n="26.240">And below, their tails are waving.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="26.241">One of all the most terrific</l>
<l n="26.242">Lies before the gate across it,</l>
<l n="26.243">Longer is he than a roof-tree,</l>
<l n="26.244">Than the roof-props is he thicker,</l>
<l n="26.245">And above, his tongue is hissing,</l>
<l n="26.246">And above, his mouth is hissing,</l>
<l n="26.247">Lifted not against another,</l>
<l n="26.248">Threatening thee, O luckless hero!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.249">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.250">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="26.251">"Such a death is perhaps for children;</l>
<l n="26.252">But 'tis not a death for heroes,</l>
<l n="26.253">For I can enchant the fire,</l>
<l n="26.254">And can quench a glowing furnace,</l>
<l n="26.255">And can ban away the serpents,</l>
<l n="26.256">Twist the snakes between my fingers.</l>
<l n="26.257">Only yesterday it happened</l>
<l n="26.258">That I ploughed a field of adders;</l>
<l n="26.259">On the ground the snakes were twisting,</l>
<l n="26.260">And my hands were all uncovered.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="26.261">With my nails I seized the vipers,</l>
<l n="26.262">In my hands I took the serpents,</l>
<l n="26.263">Ten I killed among the vipers,</l>
<l n="26.264">And the serpents black by hundreds.</l>
<l n="26.265">Still my nails are stained with snake-blood,</l>
<l n="26.266">And my hands with slime of serpents.</l>
<l n="26.267">Therefore will I not permit me,</l>
<l n="26.268">And by no means will I journey</l>
<l n="26.269">As a mouthful for the serpents,</l>
<l n="26.270">To the sharp fangs of the adders.</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="26.271">I myself will crush the monsters,</l>
<l n="26.272">Crush the nasty things to pieces,</l>
<l n="26.273">And will sing away the vipers,</l>
<l n="26.274">Drive the serpents from my pathway,</l>
<l n="26.275">Enter then the yard of Pohja,</l>
<l n="26.276">And into the house will force me.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.277">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="26.278">"O my son, forbear to venture,</l>
<l n="26.279">Into Pohjola's dread castle,</l>
<l n="26.280">House of Sariola all timbered;</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="26.281">For the men with swords are girded,</l>
<l n="26.282">Heroes all equipped for battle,</l>
<l n="26.283">Men with drink of hops excited,</l>
<l n="26.284">Very furious from their drinking.</l>
<l n="26.285">They will sing thee, most unhappy,</l>
<l n="26.286">To the swords of all the keenest;</l>
<l n="26.287">Better men their songs have vanquished,</l>
<l n="26.288">Mighty ones been overpowered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.289">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.290">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="26.291">"Well, but I have dwelt already</l>
<l n="26.292">There in Pohjola's dread fortress.</l>
<l n="26.293">Not a Lapp with spells shall chain me,</l>
<l n="26.294">Forth no son of Turja drive me.</l>
<l n="26.295">I'll enchant the Lapp by singing,</l>
<l n="26.296">Drive away the son of Turja,</l>
<l n="26.297">And in twain will sing his shoulders,</l>
<l n="26.298">From his chin his speech I'll sever,</l>
<l n="26.299">Tear his shirt apart by singing,</l>

<l n="26.305">True it is thou hast resided</l>
<l n="26.306">There in Pohjola's dread fortress,</l>
<l n="26.307">But they sent thee all a-swimming,</l>
<l n="26.308">Floating overgrown with pond-weed,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.323">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.324">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
<l n="26.325">"Let a weakling ponder o'er it,</l>
<l n="26.326">Let the worthless find such ending!</l>
<l n="26.327">After five or six years' warfare,</l>
<l n="26.328">Seven long summers spent in battle,</l>
<l n="26.329">Not a hero would concern him,</l>
<l n="26.330">Nor retire a step before it.</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="26.331">Therefore bring me now my mail-shirt,</l>
<l n="26.332">And my well-tried battle armour;</l>
<l n="26.333">I my father's sword will fetch me,</l>
<l n="26.334">And my father's sword-blade look to.</l>
<l n="26.335">In the cold it long was lying,</l>
<l n="26.336">In a dark place long was hidden;</l>
<l n="26.337">There has it been ever weeping,</l>
<l n="26.338">For a hero who should wield it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.339">Thereupon he took his mail-shirt,</l>
<l n="26.340">Took his well-tried battle armour,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="26.341">And his father's trusty weapon,</l>
<l n="26.342">Sword his father always wielded,</l>
<l n="26.343">And against the ground he thrust it,</l>
<l n="26.344">On the floor the point he rested,</l>
<l n="26.345">With his hand the sword he bended</l>
<l n="26.346">Like the fresh crown of the cherry,</l>
<l n="26.347">Or the juniper when growing.</l>
<l n="26.348">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.349">"Hard 'twill be in Pohja's castle,</l>
<l n="26.350">Rooms of Sariola the misty,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="26.351">Such a sword as this to gaze on,</l>
<l n="26.352">Such a sword-blade to encounter.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.353">From the wall his bow he lifted,</l>
<l n="26.354">From the peg he took a strong bow,</l>
<l n="26.355">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="26.356">And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
<l n="26.357">"I would hold the man deserving,</l>
<l n="26.358">And regard him as a hero,</l>
<l n="26.359">Who to bend this bow was able,</l>
<l n="26.360">And could bend it and could string it,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="26.361">There in Pohjola's great castle,</l>
<l n="26.362">Rooms of Sariola the misty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.363">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.364">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.365">Put his shirt of mail upon him,</l>
<l n="26.366">Clad himself in arms of battle,</l>
<l n="26.367">And his slave he thus commanded,</l>
<l n="26.368">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="26.369">"O my servant, bought with money,</l>
<l n="26.370">Workman, whom I got for money,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="26.371">Harness now my horse of battle,</l>
<l n="26.372">Harness me my fiery war-horse,</l>
<l n="26.373">That unto the feast I journey,</l>
<l n="26.374">Drinking-bout at house of Lempo.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.375">Then the prudent slave, obedient,</l>
<l n="26.376">Hastened quickly to the courtyard,</l>
<l n="26.377">And the foal at once he harnessed,</l>
<l n="26.378">And prepared the fiery red one,</l>
<l n="26.379">And he said on his returning,</l>
<l n="26.380">"I have done what you commanded,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="26.381">And the horse have harnessed for you,</l>
<l n="26.382">And the best of foals have harnessed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.383">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.384">Thought him ready for his journey,</l>
<l n="26.385">Right hand urging, left restraining,</l>
<l n="26.386">And his sinewy fingers smarting,</l>
<l n="26.387">Now would start, and then reflected,</l>
<l n="26.388">Started then in reckless fashion.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.389">Then her son his mother counselled,</l>
<l n="26.390">Warned her child, the aged woman,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="26.391">At the door, beneath the rafters,</l>
<l n="26.392">At the place where stand the kettles.</l>
<l n="26.393">"O my only son, my dearest,</l>
<l n="26.394">O my child, of all the strongest,</l>
<l n="26.395">When thou com'st to the carousal,</l>
<l n="26.396">And thou comest where thou wishest,</l>
<l n="26.397">Drink thou half a goblet only,</l>
<l n="26.398">Drink the measure to the middle,</l>
<l n="26.399">And the other half return thou;</l>
<l n="26.400">Give the worst half to a worse one.</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
<l n="26.401">In the goblet rests a serpent,</l>
<l n="26.402">And a worm within the measure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.403">Yet again her son she cautioned,</l>
<l n="26.404">To her child again gave warning,</l>
<l n="26.405">At the last field's furthest limit,</l>
<l n="26.406">At the last of all the gateways.</l>
<l n="26.407">"When thou com'st to the carousal,</l>
<l n="26.408">And thou comest where thou wishest,</l>
<l n="26.409">Sit upon a half-seat only,</l>
<l n="26.410">Step thou with a half-step only,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
<l n="26.411">And the other half return thou;</l>
<l n="26.412">Give the worst half to a worse one,</l>
<l n="26.413">Thus wilt thou a man be reckoned,</l>
<l n="26.414">And a most illustrious hero,</l>
<l n="26.415">And through armies push thy pathway,</l>
<l n="26.416">And will crush them down beneath thee,</l>
<l n="26.417">In the press of mighty heroes,</l>
<l n="26.418">In the throng of men of valour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.419">Then departed Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.420">When the horse in sledge was harnessed.</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
<l n="26.421">With his ready whip he struck him,</l>
<l n="26.422">With his beaded whip he smote him,</l>
<l n="26.423">And the fiery steed sprang forward,</l>
<l n="26.424">Onward sped the rapid courser.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.425">When a short way he had journeyed,</l>
<l n="26.426">For about an hour had travelled,</l>
<l n="26.427">There he saw a flock of blackfowl,</l>
<l n="26.428">In the air the grouse flew upward,</l>
<l n="26.429">And the flock ascended rushing</l>
<l n="26.430">From before the speeding courser.</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.431">On the ice there lay some feathers</l>
<l n="26.432">Cast by grouse upon the roadway;</l>
<l n="26.433">These collected Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.434">And he put them in his pocket,</l>
<l n="26.435">For he knew not what might happen,</l>
<l n="26.436">Or might chance upon his journey.</l>
<l n="26.437">In a house are all things useful,</l>
<l n="26.438">Can at need be turned to something.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.439">Then he drove a little further,</l>
<l n="26.440">On his road a little further,</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
<l n="26.441">When to neigh began the courser,</l>
<l n="26.442">Pricked his long ears up in terror.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.443">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.444">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.445">In the sledge at once leaned forward,</l>
<l n="26.446">Bending down to gaze about him.</l>
<l n="26.447">There he saw, as said his mother,</l>
<l n="26.448">As his own old mother warned him,</l>
<l n="26.449">How there flowed a fiery river,</l>
<l n="26.450">Right across the horse's pathway,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
<l n="26.451">In the stream a cataract fiery,</l>
<l n="26.452">In the fall a fiery island,</l>
<l n="26.453">On the isle a peak all fiery,</l>
<l n="26.454">On the peak a fiery eagle.</l>
<l n="26.455">In his throat the fire was seething,</l>
<l n="26.456">And his mouth with flame was glowing,</l>
<l n="26.457">And his plumage fire was flashing,</l>
<l n="26.458">And the sparks around were scattering.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.459">Kauko from afar he noticed,</l>
<l n="26.460">From afar saw Lemminkainen.</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.461">"Whither wilt thou go, O Kauko,</l>
<l n="26.462">Whither goes the son of Lempi?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.463">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.464">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.465">"Unto Pohja's feast I journey,</l>
<l n="26.466">The carousal held in secret.</l>
<l n="26.467">Turn thee on one side a little,</l>
<l n="26.468">From the youth's path do thou turn thee,</l>
<l n="26.469">Let the traveller make his journey,</l>
<l n="26.470">Do not hinder Lemminkainen,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
<l n="26.471">Therefore move aside a little,</l>
<l n="26.472">Let him now pursue his journey.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.473">Thereupon the eagle answered,</l>
<l n="26.474">Hissing from his throat of fire,</l>
<l n="26.475">"I will let the traveller pass me,</l>
<l n="26.476">Will not hinder Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.477">Through my mouth will let him hasten,</l>
<l n="26.478">Let him thus pursue his journey.</l>
<l n="26.479">Thither shall thy path direct thee,</l>
<l n="26.480">Fortunate shall be thy journey,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="26.481">To the banquet thou art seeking,</l>
<l n="26.482">Where thou all thy life may'st rest thee.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.483">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.484">And he let it not concern him,</l>
<l n="26.485">But he felt into his pocket,</l>
<l n="26.486">And his pouch he opened quickly,</l>
<l n="26.487">Took the feathers of the blackfowl,</l>
<l n="26.488">Leisurely he rubbed the feathers,</l>
<l n="26.489">And between his palms he rubbed them,</l>
<l n="26.490">'Twixt his fingers ten in number,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="26.491">And a flock of grouse created,</l>
<l n="26.492">And a flock of capercailzies,</l>
<l n="26.493">In the eagle's beak he thrust them,</l>
<l n="26.494">To his greedy throat he gave them,</l>
<l n="26.495">To the eagle's throat all fiery,</l>
<l n="26.496">In the fire-bird's beak he thrust them,</l>
<l n="26.497">Thus he freed himself from danger,</l>
<l n="26.498">And escaped the first day's danger.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.499">With his whip he struck the courser,</l>
<l n="26.500">With the beaded whip he struck him,</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="26.501">And the horse sped quickly onward,</l>
<l n="26.502">And the steed sprang lightly forward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.503">Then he drove a little further,</l>
<l n="26.504">But a little way had travelled,</l>
<l n="26.505">When the horse again was shying,</l>
<l n="26.506">And again the steed was neighing.</l>
<l n="26.507">From the sledge again he raised him,</l>
<l n="26.508">And he strove to gaze around him,</l>
<l n="26.509">And he saw, as said his mother,</l>
<l n="26.510">As his aged mother warned him,</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
<l n="26.511">Right in front a trench of fire,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.517">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.518">But he raised a prayer to Ukko.</l>
<l n="26.519">"Ukko, thou, of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="26.520">Ukko, thou, our Heavenly Father,</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>

<lg>
<l n="26.531">Ukko, then, of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="26.532">He the aged Heavenly Father,</l>
<l n="26.533">Sent a cloud from out the north-west,</l>
<l n="26.534">From the west he sent a second,</l>
<l n="26.535">In the east a cloud let gather,</l>
<l n="26.536">Let them gather in the north-east;</l>
<l n="26.537">And he heaped them all together,</l>
<l n="26.538">And he closed the gaps between them,</l>
<l n="26.539">Let the snow fall staff-deep downward,</l>
<l n="26.540">Deep as is the length of spear-shaft,</l><ref type="line number">540</ref>
<l n="26.541">On the stones to redness heated,</l>
<l n="26.542">Blocks of stone all fiery glowing.</l>
<l n="26.543">From the snow a pond was fashioned,</l>
<l n="26.544">And a lake with icy waters.</l>
<l n="26.545">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.546">Sang a bridge of ice together,</l>
<l n="26.547">Stretching right across the snow-pond,</l>
<l n="26.548">From the one bank to the other,</l>
<l n="26.549">O'er the fiery trench passed safely,</l>
<l n="26.550">Passed the second day in safety.</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.551">With his whip he urged the courser,</l>
<l n="26.552">Cracked the whip all bead-embroidered,</l>
<l n="26.553">And began to travel quickly,</l>
<l n="26.554">As the courser trotted onward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.555">Quick he ran a verst, a second,</l>
<l n="26.556">For a short space well proceeded,</l>
<l n="26.557">When he suddenly stopped standing,</l>
<l n="26.558">Would not stir from his position.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.559">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.560">Started up to gaze around him.</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
<l n="26.561">In the gate the wolf was standing,</l>

<l n="26.563">There in Pohjola's dread gateway,</l>
<l n="26.564">At the end of a long passage.</l>
<l n="26.565">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.566">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="26.567">Quickly felt into his pocket,</l>
<l n="26.568">What his pouch contained exploring,</l>
<l n="26.569">And he took some ewe's wool from it,</l>
<l n="26.570">And until 'twas soft he rubbed it,</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
<l n="26.571">And between his palms he rubbed it,</l>
<l n="26.572">'Twixt his fingers ten in number.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.573">On his palms then gently breathing,</l>
<l n="26.574">Ewes ran bleating forth between them,</l>
<l n="26.575">Quite a flock of sheep he fashioned,</l>

<l n="26.578">And the bear rushed after likewise,</l>
<l n="26.579">While the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="26.580">Further drove upon his journey.</l><ref type="line number">580</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.581">Yet a little space he journeyed,</l>
<l n="26.582">Unto Pohjola's enclosure.</l>
<l n="26.583">There a fence was raised of iron,</l>
<l n="26.584">Fenced with steel the whole enclosure,</l>
<l n="26.585">In the ground a hundred fathoms,</l>
<l n="26.586">In the sky a thousand fathoms,</l>
<l n="26.587">Spears they were which formed the hedgestakes,</l>
<l n="26.588">And for wattles creeping serpents,</l>
<l n="26.589">Thus the fence with snakes was wattled</l>
<l n="26.590">And among them there were lizards,</l><ref type="line number">590</ref>
<l n="26.591">And their tails were always waving,</l>

<l n="26.594">Heads turned out and tails turned inwards.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.595">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.596">Gave himself to his reflections.</l>
<l n="26.597">"This is what my mother told me,</l>
<l n="26.598">This is what my mother dreaded;</l>
<l n="26.599">Here I find a fence tremendous</l>

<l n="26.601">Down below there creeps a viper,</l>
<l n="26.602">Deeper yet the fence is sunken,</l>
<l n="26.603">Up aloft a bird is flying,</l>
<l n="26.604">But the fence is builded higher.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.605">Natheless was not Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="26.606">Greatly troubled or uneasy;</l>
<l n="26.607">From the sheath he drew his knife out,</l>
<l n="26.608">From the sheath an iron weapon,</l>
<l n="26.609">And he hewed the fence to pieces,</l>
<l n="26.610">And in twain he clove the hedgestakes;</l><ref type="line number">610</ref>
<l n="26.611">Thus he breached the fence of iron,</l>
<l n="26.612">And he drove away the serpents</l>
<l n="26.613">From the space between five hedgestakes,</l>
<l n="26.614">Likewise from the space 'twixt seven,</l>
<l n="26.615">And himself pursued his journey,</l>
<l n="26.616">On to Pohjola's dark portal.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="26.617">In the path a snake was twisting,</l>
<l n="26.618">Just in front across the doorway,</l>

<head>THE DUEL AT POHJOLA</head>
<div type="argument">
Lemminkainen comes to Pohjola and behaves with the greatest insolence (1-204). The Lord of Pohjola grows angry, and as he can do nothing against Lemminkainen by magic, he challenges him to a duel (205-282). In the course of the duel Lemminkainen strikes off the head of the Lord of Pohjola, and to avenge this, the Mistress of Pohjola raises an army against him (283-420).

<l n="27.005">To the banquet held at Pohja,</l>

<l n="27.014">To the drinking-bout unbidden.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.015">Thus the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.016">Ruddy youth, and arrant scoundrel,</l>
<l n="27.017">In the room at once came forward,</l>
<l n="27.018">Walking to the very middle;</l>
<l n="27.019">'Neath him swayed the floor of linden,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.021">Spoke the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.022">And he said the words which follow:</l>

<l n="27.024">Greetings also to the greeter!</l>
<l n="27.025">Hearken, Pohjola's great Master,</l>

<l n="27.054">For his horse within the stable,</l>
<l n="27.055">And a clean room for the hero,</l>
<l n="27.056">And a place to put his gloves in,</l>
<l n="27.057">Pegs whereon to hang his mittens,</l>
<l n="27.058">Walls where swords may rest in order.</l>

<l n="27.061">After this he strode on further,</l>

<lg>
<l n="27.067">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.068">"Seems to me that I'm unwelcome,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.071">Ilpotar, the noble Mistress,</l>

<l n="27.073">"O thou boy, O Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.074">Not as guest thou com'st among us,</l>
<l n="27.075">But upon my head to trample,</l>

<l n="27.078">Still in malt the drink delicious,</l>

<l n="27.111">But I poured it out in bushels,</l>

<l n="27.145">Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
<l n="27.146">Looked at once into the pint-pot,</l>
<l n="27.147">And below a worm was creeping,</l>
<l n="27.148">In the midst there crept a serpent,</l>

<l n="27.165">Then he felt into his pocket,</l>

<l n="27.181">Then he drank the ale with gusto,</l>

<l n="27.190">No gigantic steer was slaughtered,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="27.191">In the hall no ox they brought me,</l>
<l n="27.192">From the house of hooféd cattle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.193">Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.194">Answer in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="27.195">"Wherefore have you then come hither,</l>
<l n="27.196">Who invited you among us?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.197">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.198">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
<l n="27.199">"Good is perhaps the guest invited,</l>
<l n="27.200">Better still if uninvited.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="27.201">Hearken then, thou son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.202">Pohjola's illustrious Master,</l>
<l n="27.203">Give me ale for cash directly,</l>
<l n="27.204">Reach me here some drink for money.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.205">Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.206">Angry grow and greatly furious,</l>
<l n="27.207">Very furious and indignant,</l>
<l n="27.208">Sang a pond upon the flooring,</l>
<l n="27.209">In the front of Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.210">And he said the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="27.211">"Here's a river you may drink of,</l>
<l n="27.212">Here's a pond that you may splash in.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.213">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.214">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="27.215">"I'm no calf by women driven,</l>
<l n="27.216">Nor a bull with tail behind me,</l>
<l n="27.217">That I drink of river-water,</l>
<l n="27.218">Or from filthy ponds the water.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.219">Then himself began to conjure,</l>
<l n="27.220">And, himself commenced his singing,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="27.221">Sang upon the floor a bullock,</l>
<l n="27.222">Mighty ox with horns all golden,</l>
<l n="27.223">And he soon drank up the puddle,</l>
<l n="27.224">Drank the river up with pleasure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.225">But the mighty son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.226">By his spells a wolf created,</l>
<l n="27.227">And upon the floor he sang him,</l>
<l n="27.228">To devour the fleshy bullock.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.229">Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
<l n="27.230">Sang a white hare to his presence,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="27.231">And upon the floor 'twas leaping,</l>
<l n="27.232">Near the wolf-jaws widely opened.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.233">But the mighty son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.234">Sang a dog with pointed muzzle;</l>
<l n="27.235">And the dog the hare devoured,</l>
<l n="27.236">Rent the Squint-eye into fragments.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.237">Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
<l n="27.238">On the rafters sang a squirrel,</l>
<l n="27.239">And it frolicked on the rafters,</l>
<l n="27.240">And the dog was barking at it.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.241">But the mighty son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.242">Sang a golden-breasted marten,</l>
<l n="27.243">And the marten seized the squirrel,</l>
<l n="27.244">On the rafter's end while sitting.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.245">Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
<l n="27.246">Sang a fox of ruddy colour,</l>
<l n="27.247">And it killed the gold-breast marten,</l>
<l n="27.248">And destroyed the handsome-haired one.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.249">But the mighty son of Pohja</l>
<l n="27.250">By his spells a hen created,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="27.251">And upon the ground 'twas walking,</l>
<l n="27.252">Just before the fox's muzzle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.253">Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
<l n="27.254">Thereupon a hawk created,</l>
<l n="27.255">Quickly with its claws it seized it,</l>
<l n="27.256">And it tore the hen to pieces.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.257">Then said Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.258">In the very words which follow:</l>
<l n="27.259">"Better will not be the banquet,</l>
<l n="27.260">Nor the guest-provision lessened.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="27.261">House for work, the road for strangers,</l>
<l n="27.262">Unrefreshed from the carousal!</l>
<l n="27.263">Quit this place, O scamp of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="27.264">Haste away from all folks' knowledge,</l>
<l n="27.265">To thy home, O toad the basest,</l>
<l n="27.266">Forth, O scoundrel, to thy country!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.267">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.268">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="27.269">"None would let himself be banished,</l>
<l n="27.270">Not a man, how bad soever,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="27.271">From this place be ever driven,</l>
<l n="27.272">Forced to fly from such a station.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.273">Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.274">Snatch his sword from wall where hanging,</l>
<l n="27.275">Grasped in haste the sharpened weapon,</l>
<l n="27.276">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="27.277">"O thou Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
<l n="27.278">Or thou handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="27.279">Let us match our swords together,</l>
<l n="27.280">Match the glitter of the sword-blades,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="27.281">Whether my sword is the better,</l>
<l n="27.282">Or is Ahti Saarelainen's.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.283">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.284">"Little of my sword is left me,</l>
<l n="27.285">For on bones it has been shattered,</l>
<l n="27.286">And on skulls completely broken!</l>
<l n="27.287">But let this be as it may be,</l>
<l n="27.288">If no better feast is ready,</l>
<l n="27.289">Let us struggle, and determine</l>
<l n="27.290">Which of our two swords is favoured.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="27.291">Ne'er in former times my father</l>
<l n="27.292">In a duel has been worsted,</l>
<l n="27.293">Why should then his son be different,</l>
<l n="27.294">Or his child be like a baby?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.295">Sword he took, and bared his sword-blade,</l>
<l n="27.296">And he drew his sharp-edged weapon,</l>
<l n="27.297">Drew it from the leather scabbard,</l>
<l n="27.298">Hanging at his belt of lambskin.</l>
<l n="27.299">Then they measured and inspected</l>
<l n="27.300">Which of their two swords was longer,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="27.301">And a very little longer,</l>
<l n="27.302">Was the sword of Pohja's Master,</l>
<l n="27.303">As upon the nail the blackness,</l>
<l n="27.304">Or a half-joint of a finger.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.305">Spoke then Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
<l n="27.306">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="27.307">"As your sword is rather longer,</l>
<l n="27.308">Let the first attack be yours.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.309">Then did Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.310">Aim a blow, and tried to strike him,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="27.311">Aimed his sword, but never struck it,</l>
<l n="27.312">On the head of Lemminkainen.</l>
<l n="27.313">Once indeed he struck the rafters,</l>
<l n="27.314">And the beams resounded loudly,</l>
<l n="27.315">And across the beam was shattered,</l>
<l n="27.316">And the arch in twain was broken.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.317">Then spoke Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
<l n="27.318">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
<l n="27.319">"Well, what mischief did the rafters,</l>
<l n="27.320">And what harm the beam effected,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="27.321">That you thus attack the rafters,</l>
<l n="27.322">And have made the arch to rattle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.323">"Hear me, son of Pohja's country,</l>
<l n="27.324">Pohjola's illustrious Master,</l>
<l n="27.325">Awkward 'tis in room to combat,</l>
<l n="27.326">Trouble would it give the women,</l>
<l n="27.327">If the clean room should be damaged,</l>
<l n="27.328">And with blood defiled the flooring.</l>
<l n="27.329">Let us go into the courtyard,</l>
<l n="27.330">In the field outside to battle,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="27.331">On the grass outside to combat.</l>
<l n="27.332">In the yard the blood looks better,</l>
<l n="27.333">In the yard it looks more lovely,</l>
<l n="27.334">On the snow it looks much better.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.335">Out into the yard they wandered,</l>
<l n="27.336">And they found therein a cowhide,</l>
<l n="27.337">And they spread it in the courtyard,</l>
<l n="27.338">And they took their stand upon it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.339">Then said Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
<l n="27.340">"Hearken, O thou son of Pohja!</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="27.341">As your sword is rather longer,</l>
<l n="27.342">And your sword is more terrific,</l>
<l n="27.343">Perhaps indeed you need to use it,</l>
<l n="27.344">Just before your own departure,</l>
<l n="27.345">Or before your neck is broken.</l>
<l n="27.346">Strike away, O son of Pohja.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.347">Fenced away the son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.348">Struck a blow, and struck a second,</l>
<l n="27.349">And he struck a third blow after,</l>
<l n="27.350">But he could not strike him fairly,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="27.351">Could not scratch the flesh upon him,</l>
<l n="27.352">From his skin a single bristle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.353">Then spoke Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
<l n="27.354">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="27.355">"Give me leave to try a little,</l>
<l n="27.356">For at last my time is coming.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.357">Natheless Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.358">Did not pay the least attention,</l>
<l n="27.359">Striking on, without reflection,</l>
<l n="27.360">Ever striking, never hitting.</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="27.361">From his sword-blade flashed red fire,</l>
<l n="27.362">And its edge was always gleaming</l>
<l n="27.363">In the hands of Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.364">And the sheen extended further,</l>
<l n="27.365">As against the neck he turned it,</l>
<l n="27.366">Of the mighty son of Pohja.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.367">Said the handsome Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.368">"Hearken, Pohjola's great Master,</l>
<l n="27.369">True it is, thy neck so wretched,</l>
<l n="27.370">Is as red as dawn of morning."</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.371">Thereupon the son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.372">He, the mighty lord of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.373">Bent his eyes that he might witness</l>
<l n="27.374">How his own neck had been reddened.</l>
<l n="27.375">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="27.376">Hurriedly a stroke delivered,</l>
<l n="27.377">With his sword he struck the hero,</l>
<l n="27.378">Quickly with the sword he struck him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.379">Full and fair he struck the hero,</l>
<l n="27.380">Struck his head from off his shoulders,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="27.381">And the skull from neck he severed,</l>
<l n="27.382">As from off the stalk a turnip,</l>
<l n="27.383">Or an ear of corn is severed,</l>
<l n="27.384">From a fish a fin divided.</l>
<l n="27.385">In the yard the head went rolling,</l>
<l n="27.386">And the skull in the enclosure,</l>
<l n="27.387">As when it is struck by arrow</l>
<l n="27.388">Falls the capercail from tree-top.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.389">In the ground stood stakes a hundred,</l>
<l n="27.390">In the yard there stood a thousand,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="27.391">On the stakes were heads a hundred,</l>
<l n="27.392">Only one stake still was headless.</l>
<l n="27.393">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="27.394">Took the head of the poor fellow;</l>
<l n="27.395">From the ground the skull he lifted,</l>
<l n="27.396">And upon the stake he set it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.397">Then did Ahti Saarelainen,</l>
<l n="27.398">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="27.399">Once again the house re-enter,</l>
<l n="27.400">And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
<l n="27.401">"Wicked maid, now bring me water,</l>
<l n="27.402">That I wash my hands and cleanse them,</l>
<l n="27.403">From the blood of wicked Master,</l>
<l n="27.404">From the gore of man of evil.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="27.405">Furious was the Crone of Pohja,</l>
<l n="27.406">Wild with wrath and indignation,</l>
<l n="27.407">And at once she sang up swordsmen,</l>
<l n="27.408">Heroes well equipped for battle.</l>
<l n="27.409">Up she sang a hundred swordsmen,</l>
<l n="27.410">Sang a thousand weapon-bearers,</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>

<l n="27.413">Now the time seemed really coming,</l>
<l n="27.414">Fitting time for his departure,</l>
<l n="27.415">Terror came at length upon him,</l>
<l n="27.416">And too hard the task before him;</l>
<l n="27.417">From the house the youthful Ahti</l>
<l n="27.418">Lemminkainen quick departed,</l>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN AND HIS MOTHER</head>
<div type="argument">
Lemminkainen escapes with all speed from Pohjola, comes home and asks his mother where he can hide himself from the people of Pohjola, who will soon attack him in his home, a hundred to one (1-164). His mother reproaches him for his expedition to Pohjola, suggests various places of concealment, and at length advises him to go far across the lakes to a distant island, where his father once lived in peace during a year of great war (165-294).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="28.001">Then did Ahti Saarelainen,</l>

<l n="28.006">From the gloomy house of Sara.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.007">From the room he rushed like snowfall,</l>
<l n="28.008">To the yard like snake he hurried,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.011">When he came into the courtyard,</l>
<l n="28.012">Then he gazed around and pondered,</l>
<l n="28.013">Seeking for the horse he left there,</l>
<l n="28.014">But he nowhere saw him standing;</l>
<l n="28.015">In the field a stone was standing,</l>
<l n="28.016">On the waste a clump of willows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.017">Who will come to give him counsel,</l>
<l n="28.018">Who will now advise and help him,</l>
<l n="28.019">That his head come not in danger,</l>
<l n="28.020">And his hair remain uninjured,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="28.021">Nor his handsome hair be draggled</l>
<l n="28.022">In the courtyard foul of Pohja?</l>
<l n="28.023">In the village heard he shouting,</l>
<l n="28.024">Uproar too from other homesteads,</l>
<l n="28.025">Lights were shining in the village,</l>
<l n="28.026">Eyes were at the open windows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.027">Then must lively Lemminkainen,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.035">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="28.036">Sent aloft a prayer to Ukko:</l>
<l n="28.037">"Ukko, Jumala most gracious,</l>

<lg>
<l n="28.047">As he flew upon his journey,</l>
<l n="28.048">As he chanced to look behind him,</l>
<l n="28.049">There he saw a hawk, a grey one,</l>
<l n="28.050">And its eyes were fiery-glowing,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="28.051">As it were the son of Pohja,</l>

<l n="28.057">Then said Ahti Saarelainen,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.147">Then his mother interrupted,</l>
<l n="28.148">Asking him his cause of trouble.</l>
<l n="28.149">"Wherefore whet the men their sword-blades,</l>
<l n="28.150">Wherefore sharpen they the lance-tips?"</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.151">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="28.152">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="28.153">"Therefore do they whet their sword-blades,</l>

<l n="28.155">On the head of me unhappy,</l>

<l n="28.157">From a quarrel rose a duel,</l>
<l n="28.158">There in Pohjola's enclosure;</l>
<l n="28.159">I have slain the son of Pohja,</l>

<lg>
<l n="28.177">"Whither now, my son unhappy,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.185">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="28.186">"No such refuge do I know of,</l>
<l n="28.187">Where a safe retreat awaits me,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="28.191">Answered Lemminkainen's mother,</l>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN'S ADVENTURES ON THE ISLAND</head>
<div type="argument">
Lemminkainen sails across the lakes in his boat and comes safely to the island (1-180). There he lives pleasantly among the girls and women till the return of the men from warfare, who conspire against him (181-290). Lemminkainen flies from the island, much to the grief both of the girls and himself (291-402). His boat is wrecked in a violent storm, but he escapes by swimming to land, makes a new boat, and arrives safely on the shores of his own country (403-452). He finds his old house burned, and the whole surroundings laid waste, when he begins to weep and lament, especially for the loss of his mother (453-514). His mother, however, is still alive, having taken refuge in a thick forest where Lemminkainen finds her to his great joy (515-546). She relates how the army of Pohjola came and burned down the house. Lemminkainen promises to build a finer house after he has revenged himself upon the people of Pohjola, and describes his pleasant life in the island of refuge (547-602).

<lg>
<l n="29.001">Lemminkainen, youth so lively,</l>
<l n="29.002">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="29.003">Took provisions in his satchel,</l>
<l n="29.004">In his wallet summer-butter,</l>
<l n="29.005">Butter for a year to last him,</l>
<l n="29.006">For another, pork sufficient,</l>
<l n="29.007">Then he travelled off to hide him,</l>
<l n="29.008">Started in the greatest hurry,</l>
<l n="29.009">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="29.010">"Now I go, and I'm escaping,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="29.011">For the space of three whole summers,</l>
<l n="29.012">And for five years in succession.</l>
<l n="29.013">Be the land to snakes abandoned,</l>
<l n="29.014">Let the lynxes snarl in greenwood,</l>
<l n="29.015">In the fields the reindeer wander,</l>
<l n="29.016">In the brakes the geese conceal them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.017">"Fare thee well, my dearest mother,</l>
<l n="29.018">If the people come from Pohja,</l>
<l n="29.019">From Pimentola the army,</l>
<l n="29.020">And about my head they ask you,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="29.021">Say that I have fled before them,</l>
<l n="29.022">And have taken my departure,</l>
<l n="29.023">And I have laid waste my clearing,</l>
<l n="29.024">That which I had reaped so lately.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.025">Then he pushed his boat in water,</l>
<l n="29.026">On the waves he launched his vessel,</l>
<l n="29.027">From the rollers steel he launched it,</l>
<l n="29.028">From the haven lined with copper.</l>
<l n="29.029">On the mast the sails he hoisted,</l>
<l n="29.030">And he spread the sails of linen,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="29.031">At the stern himself he seated,</l>
<l n="29.032">And prepared him for his journey,</l>
<l n="29.033">Sitting by his birchwood rudder,</l>
<l n="29.034">With the stern-oar deftly steering.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.035">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="29.036">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="29.037">"Wind, inflate the sails above me,</l>
<l n="29.038">Wind of spring drive on the vessel,</l>
<l n="29.039">Drive with speed the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="29.040">Onward drive the boat of pinewood</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="29.041">Forward to the nameless island,</l>
<l n="29.042">And the nameless promontory.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.043">So the wind the bark drove onward,</l>
<l n="29.044">O'er the foaming lake 'twas driven,</l>
<l n="29.045">O'er the bright expanse of water,</l>
<l n="29.046">Speeding o'er the open water,</l>
<l n="29.047">Rocking while two moons were changing,</l>
<l n="29.048">Till a third was near its ending.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.049">At the cape were maidens sitting,</l>
<l n="29.050">There upon the blue lake's margin</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="29.051">They were gazing, and were casting</l>
<l n="29.052">Glances o'er the azure billows.</l>
<l n="29.053">One was waiting for her brother,</l>
<l n="29.054">And another for her father,</l>
<l n="29.055">But the others all were waiting,</l>
<l n="29.056">Waiting each one for a lover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.057">In the distance spied they Kauko,</l>
<l n="29.058">Sooner still the boat of Kauko,</l>
<l n="29.059">Like a little cloud in distance,</l>
<l n="29.060">Just between the sky and water.</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.061">And the island-maids reflected,</l>
<l n="29.062">Said the maidens of the island:</l>
<l n="29.063">"What's this strange thing in the water,</l>
<l n="29.064">What this wonder on the billows?</l>
<l n="29.065">If a boat of our relations,</l>

<l n="29.067">Hasten then, and speed thee homeward,</l>
<l n="29.068">To the harbour of the island,</l>

<l n="29.070">Hear the news from foreign countries,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="29.071">If there's peace among the shore-folks,</l>
<l n="29.072">Or if war is waged among them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.073">Still the wind the sail inflated,</l>
<l n="29.074">And the billows drove the vessel.</l>
<l n="29.075">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="29.076">Guided to the isle the vessel,</l>
<l n="29.077">To the island's end he drove it,</l>
<l n="29.078">Where it ends in jutting headland.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.079">And he said on his arrival,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.085">Said the girls upon the island,</l>

<l n="29.107">"There is room upon this island,</l>
<l n="29.108">On the surface of the island,</l>
<l n="29.109">Where a little man may hide him,</l>

<l n="29.114">And a thousand men of valour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.115">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.116">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="29.117">"Is there room upon this island,</l>
<l n="29.118">On the surface of the island,</l>
<l n="29.119">Where there stands a birch-tree forest,</l>

<l n="29.123">Said the girls upon the island,</l>
<l n="29.124">And the island-maidens answered:</l>
<l n="29.125">"There is not upon this island,</l>
<l n="29.126">On the surface of the island,</l>
<l n="29.127">Not the space your back could rest on,</l>
<l n="29.128">Land not of a bushel's measure,</l>

<l n="29.130">Work upon your goodly clearing.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="29.131">All the land is now divided,</l>

<l n="29.134">Grassland managed by the commune.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.135">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.136">Asked the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="29.137">"Is there room upon this island,</l>
<l n="29.138">On the surface of the island,</l>
<l n="29.139">Space where I my songs may carol,</l>
<l n="29.140">Space where I may sing my ballads?</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="29.141">Words within my mouth are melting,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.143">Said the girls upon the island,</l>
<l n="29.144">And the island-maidens answered:</l>
<l n="29.145">"There is room upon this island,</l>
<l n="29.146">On the surface of the island,</l>
<l n="29.147">Space where you may sing your ballads,</l>
<l n="29.148">And intone your splendid verses,</l>
<l n="29.149">While you sport amid the greenwood,</l>
<l n="29.150">While you dance among the meadows."</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.151">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="29.152">Hastened to commence his singing.</l>
<l n="29.153">In the court sang mountain-ashtrees,</l>
<l n="29.154">In the farmyard oaks grew upward.</l>
<l n="29.155">On the oaks were equal branches,</l>
<l n="29.156">And on every branch an acorn,</l>
<l n="29.157">Golden globes within the acorns,</l>
<l n="29.158">And upon the globes were cuckoos.</l>
<l n="29.159">When the cuckoos all were calling,</l>
<l n="29.160">From their mouths was gold distilling,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="29.161">From their beaks was copper flowing,</l>
<l n="29.162">Likewise silver pouring onward</l>
<l n="29.163">To the hills all golden-shining,</l>
<l n="29.164">And among the silver mountains.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.165">Once again sang Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.166">Once again he sang and chanted,</l>
<l n="29.167">Gravel sang to pearls of beauty,</l>
<l n="29.168">All the stones to gleaming lustre,</l>
<l n="29.169">All the stones to glowing redness,</l>
<l n="29.170">And the flowers to golden glory.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.171">Then again sang Lemminkainen;</l>
<l n="29.172">In the yard a well created,</l>
<l n="29.173">O'er the well a golden cover,</l>
<l n="29.174">And on this a golden bucket,</l>
<l n="29.175">That the lads might drink the water,</l>
<l n="29.176">And their sisters wash their faces.</l>
<l n="29.177">Ponds he sang upon the meadows,</l>
<l n="29.178">In the ponds blue ducks were floating,</l>
<l n="29.179">Temples golden, heads of silver,</l>
<l n="29.180">And their claws were all of copper.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.181">Then the island-maidens wondered,</l>
<l n="29.182">And the girls were all astounded</l>
<l n="29.183">At the songs of Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.184">And the craft of that great hero.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.185">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.186">Spoke the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="29.187">"I have sung a song most splendid,</l>
<l n="29.188">But perchance might sing a better,</l>
<l n="29.189">If beneath a roof I sang it,</l>
<l n="29.190">At the end of the deal table.</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="29.191">If a house you cannot give me,</l>
<l n="29.192">There to rest upon the planking,</l>
<l n="29.193">I will hum my tunes in forest,</l>
<l n="29.194">Toss my songs among the bushes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.195">Said the maidens of the island,</l>
<l n="29.196">Answered after full reflection:</l>
<l n="29.197">"There are houses you may enter,</l>
<l n="29.198">Handsome halls that you may dwell in,</l>
<l n="29.199">Safe from cold to sing your verses,</l>
<l n="29.200">In the open speak your magic."</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.201">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.202">Entered in a house directly,</l>
<l n="29.203">Where he sang a row of pint-pots,</l>
<l n="29.204">At the end of the long table.</l>
<l n="29.205">All the pots with ale were brimming,</l>
<l n="29.206">And the cans with mead the finest,</l>
<l n="29.207">Filled as full as one could fill them,</l>
<l n="29.208">Dishes filled to overflowing.</l>
<l n="29.209">In the pots was beer in plenty,</l>
<l n="29.210">And the mead in covered tankards,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="29.211">Butter too, in great abundance,</l>
<l n="29.212">Pork was likewise there in plenty,</l>
<l n="29.213">For the feast of Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.214">And for Kaukomieli's pleasure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.215">Kauko was of finest manners,</l>
<l n="29.216">Nor to eat was he accustomed,</l>
<l n="29.217">Only with a knife of silver,</l>
<l n="29.218">Fitted with a golden handle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.219">So he sang a knife of silver,</l>
<l n="29.220">And a golden-hafted knife-blade,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="29.221">And he ate till he was sated,</l>
<l n="29.222">Drank the ale in full contentment.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.223">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.224">Roamed about through every village,</l>
<l n="29.225">For the island-maidens' pleasure,</l>
<l n="29.226">To delight the braidless damsels,</l>
<l n="29.227">And where'er his head was turning,</l>
<l n="29.228">There he found a mouth for kissing,</l>
<l n="29.229">Wheresoe'er his hand was outstretched,</l>
<l n="29.230">There he found a hand to clasp it.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.231">And at night he went to rest him,</l>
<l n="29.232">Hiding in the darkest corner;</l>
<l n="29.233">There was not a single village</l>
<l n="29.234">Where he did not find ten homesteads,</l>
<l n="29.235">There was not a single homestead</l>
<l n="29.236">Where he did not find ten daughters,</l>
<l n="29.237">There was none among the daughters,</l>
<l n="29.238">None among the mother's children,</l>
<l n="29.239">By whose side he did not stretch him,</l>
<l n="29.240">On whose arm he did not rest him.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.241">Thus a thousand brides he found there,</l>
<l n="29.242">Rested by a hundred widows;</l>
<l n="29.243">Two in half-a-score remained not,</l>
<l n="29.244">Three in a completed hundred,</l>
<l n="29.245">Whom he left untouched as maidens,</l>
<l n="29.246">Or as widows unmolested.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.247">Thus the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="29.248">Lived a life of great enjoyment,</l>
<l n="29.249">For the course of three whole summers</l>
<l n="29.250">In the island's pleasant hamlets,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="29.251">To the island-maidens' rapture,</l>
<l n="29.252">The content of all the widows;</l>
<l n="29.253">One alone he did not trouble,</l>
<l n="29.254">'Twas a poor and aged maiden,</l>
<l n="29.255">At the furthest promontory,</l>
<l n="29.256">In the tenth among the hamlets.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.257">As he pondered on his journey,</l>
<l n="29.258">And resolved to wend him homeward,</l>
<l n="29.259">Came the poor and aged maiden,</l>
<l n="29.260">And she spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="29.261">"Handsome hero, wretched Kauko,</l>
<l n="29.262">If you will not think upon me,</l>
<l n="29.263">Then I wish that as you travel,</l>
<l n="29.264">May your boat on rocks be stranded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.265">Rose he not before the cockcrow,</l>
<l n="29.266">Nor before the hen's child rose he,</l>
<l n="29.267">From his sporting with the maiden,</l>
<l n="29.268">Laughing with the wretched woman.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.269">Then upon a day it happened,</l>
<l n="29.270">And upon a certain evening,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="29.271">He resolved to rise and wander,</l>
<l n="29.272">Waiting not for morn or cockcrow.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.273">Long before the time he rose up,</l>
<l n="29.274">Sooner than the time intended,</l>
<l n="29.275">And he went around to wander,</l>
<l n="29.276">And to wander through the village,</l>
<l n="29.277">For his sporting with the damsels,</l>
<l n="29.278">To amuse the wretched women.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.279">As alone by night he wandered,</l>
<l n="29.280">Through the villages he sauntered</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="29.281">To the isle's extremest headland,</l>
<l n="29.282">To the tenth among the hamlets,</l>
<l n="29.283">He beheld not any homestead</l>
<l n="29.284">Where three rooms he did not notice,</l>
<l n="29.285">There was not a room among them</l>
<l n="29.286">Where he did not see three heroes,</l>
<l n="29.287">And he saw not any hero,</l>
<l n="29.288">With a sword-blade left unwhetted,</l>
<l n="29.289">Sharpened thus to bring destruction</l>
<l n="29.290">On the head of Lemminkainen.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.291">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="29.292">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="29.293">"Woe to me, the day is dawning,</l>
<l n="29.294">And the pleasant sun is rising</l>
<l n="29.295">O'er a youth, of all most wretched,</l>
<l n="29.296">O'er the neck of me unhappy!</l>
<l n="29.297">Lempo may perchance a hero</l>
<l n="29.298">With his shirt protect and cover,</l>
<l n="29.299">Perhaps will cover with his mantle,</l>
<l n="29.300">Cast it round him for protection</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="29.301">Though a hundred men attacked him,</l>
<l n="29.302">And a thousand pressed upon him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.303">Unembraced he left the maidens,</l>
<l n="29.304">And he left them unmolested,</l>
<l n="29.305">And he turned him to his vessel,</l>
<l n="29.306">Luckless to his boat he hurried,</l>
<l n="29.307">But he found it burned to ashes,</l>
<l n="29.308">Utterly consumed to ashes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.309">Mischief now he saw approaching,</l>
<l n="29.310">O'er his head ill days were brooding,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="29.311">So began to build a vessel,</l>
<l n="29.312">And a new boat to construct him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.313">Wood was failing to the craftsman,</l>
<l n="29.314">Boards with which a boat to fashion,</l>
<l n="29.315">But he found of wood a little,</l>
<l n="29.316">Begged some wretched bits of boarding,</l>
<l n="29.317">Five small splinters of a spindle,</l>
<l n="29.318">And six fragments of a bobbin.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.319">So from these a boat he fashioned,</l>
<l n="29.320">And a new boat he constructed,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="29.321">By his magic art he made it,</l>
<l n="29.322">With his secret knowledge made it,</l>
<l n="29.323">Hammered once, one side he fashioned,</l>
<l n="29.324">Hammered twice, called up the other,</l>
<l n="29.325">Hammered then a third time only,</l>
<l n="29.326">And the boat was quite completed.</l>
<l n="29.327">Then he pushed the boat in water,</l>
<l n="29.328">On the waves he launched the vessel,</l>
<l n="29.329">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="29.330">And expressed himself in thiswise:</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="29.331">"Float like bladder on the water,</l>
<l n="29.332">On the waves like water-lily.</l>
<l n="29.333">Eagle, give me now three feathers,</l>
<l n="29.334">Eagle, three, and two from raven,</l>
<l n="29.335">For the wretched boat's protection,</l>
<l n="29.336">For the wretched vessel's bulwarks.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.337">Then he stepped upon the planking,</l>
<l n="29.338">At the stern he took his station,</l>
<l n="29.339">Head bowed down, in deep depression,</l>
<l n="29.340">And his cap awry adjusted,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="29.341">Since by night he dare not tarry,</l>

<l n="29.365">"'Tis not for the maidens' coyness,</l>
<l n="29.366">Nor the scarcity of women.</l>
<l n="29.367">I have had a hundred women,</l>

<l n="29.377">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>

<l n="29.379">Blew the wind, and then it blustered,</l>
<l n="29.380">Rising waves drove on the vessel</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>

<l n="29.387">Wept for long the island-maidens,</l>
<l n="29.388">Damsels on the cape lamented,</l>

<lg>
<l n="29.395">Lemminkainen too was weeping,</l>

<l n="29.431">And a can of ale would fetch me,</l>
<l n="29.432">And a strip of pork would fetch me,</l>
<l n="29.433">In the pan would broil it for me,</l>
<l n="29.434">And would pour some butter on it,</l>
<l n="29.435">That the weary man might eat it,</l>
<l n="29.436">And the fainting hero drink it.</l>
<l n="29.437">Nights and days have I been swimming</l>
<l n="29.438">Out upon the broad lake's billows,</l>
<l n="29.439">With the wind as my protector,</l>
<l n="29.440">At the mercy of the lake-waves."</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.441">Thereupon the gracious mistress</l>
<l n="29.442">Hastened to the mountain storehouse,</l>
<l n="29.443">Sliced some butter in the storehouse,</l>
<l n="29.444">And a slice of pork provided,</l>
<l n="29.445">In the pan thereafter broiled it,</l>
<l n="29.446">That the hungry man might eat it.</l>
<l n="29.447">Then she fetched of ale a canful,</l>
<l n="29.448">For the fainting hero's drinking,</l>
<l n="29.449">And she gave him a new vessel,</l>
<l n="29.450">And a boat completely finished,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
<l n="29.451">Which to other lands should take him,</l>
<l n="29.452">And convey him to his birthplace.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.453">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="29.454">Started on his homeward journey,</l>
<l n="29.455">Saw the lands and saw the beaches,</l>
<l n="29.456">Here the islands, there the channels,</l>
<l n="29.457">Saw the ancient landing-stages,</l>
<l n="29.458">Saw the former dwelling-places,</l>
<l n="29.459">And he saw the pine-clad mountains,</l>
<l n="29.460">All the hills with fir-trees covered,</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
<l n="29.461">But he found no more his homestead,</l>
<l n="29.462">And the walls he found not standing;</l>
<l n="29.463">Where the house before was standing,</l>
<l n="29.464">Rustled now a cherry-thicket,</l>
<l n="29.465">On the mound were pine-trees growing,</l>
<l n="29.466">Juniper beside the well-spring.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.467">Spoke the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.468">Said the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="29.469">"I have roamed among these forests,</l>
<l n="29.470">O'er the stones, and plunged in river,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
<l n="29.471">And have played about the meadows,</l>
<l n="29.472">And have wandered through the cornfields.</l>
<l n="29.473">Who has spoiled my well-known homestead,</l>
<l n="29.474">And destroyed my charming dwelling?</l>
<l n="29.475">They have burned the house to ashes,</l>
<l n="29.476">And the wind's dispersed the ashes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.477">Thereupon he fell to weeping,</l>
<l n="29.478">And he wept one day, a second,</l>
<l n="29.479">But he wept not for the homestead,</l>
<l n="29.480">Nor lamented for the storehouse,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="29.481">But he wept the house's treasure,</l>
<l n="29.482">Dearer to him than the storehouse.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.483">Then he saw a bird was flying,</l>
<l n="29.484">And a golden eagle hovering,</l>
<l n="29.485">And he then began to ask it:</l>
<l n="29.486">"O my dearest golden eagle,</l>
<l n="29.487">Can you not perchance inform me,</l>
<l n="29.488">What has happened to my mother,</l>
<l n="29.489">To the fair one who has borne me,</l>
<l n="29.490">To my dear and much-loved mother?"</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.491">Nothing knew the eagle of her,</l>
<l n="29.492">Nor the stupid bird could tell him,</l>
<l n="29.493">Only knew that she had perished;</l>
<l n="29.494">Said a raven she had fallen,</l>
<l n="29.495">And had died beneath the sword-blades,</l>
<l n="29.496">'Neath the battle-axes fallen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.497">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.498">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
<l n="29.499">"O my fair one who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="29.500">O my dear and much-loved mother!</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="29.501">Hast thou perished, who hast borne me,</l>
<l n="29.502">Hast thou gone, O tender mother?</l>
<l n="29.503">Now thy flesh in earth has rotted,</l>
<l n="29.504">Fir-trees o'er thy head are growing,</l>
<l n="29.505">Juniper upon thy ankles,</l>
<l n="29.506">On thy finger-tips are willows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.507">"Thus my wretched doom has found me,</l>
<l n="29.508">And an ill reward has reached me,</l>
<l n="29.509">That my sword I dared to measure,</l>
<l n="29.510">And I dared to raise my weapons</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
<l n="29.511">There in Pohjola's great castle,</l>
<l n="29.512">In the fields of Pimentola.</l>
<l n="29.513">But my own race now has perished,</l>
<l n="29.514">Perished now is she who bore me.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.515">Then he looked, and turned on all sides,</l>
<l n="29.516">And he saw a trace of footsteps,</l>
<l n="29.517">Where the grass was lightly trampled,</l>
<l n="29.518">And the heath was slightly broken.</l>
<l n="29.519">Then he went the way they led him,</l>
<l n="29.520">And he found a little pathway;</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
<l n="29.521">To the forest led the pathway,</l>
<l n="29.522">And he went in that direction.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.523">Thus he walked a verst, a second,</l>
<l n="29.524">Hurried through a stretch of country,</l>
<l n="29.525">And in darkest shades of forest,</l>
<l n="29.526">In the most concealed recesses,</l>
<l n="29.527">There he saw a hidden bath-house,</l>
<l n="29.528">Saw a little cottage hidden,</l>
<l n="29.529">In a cleft two rocks protected,</l>
<l n="29.530">In a nook between three fir-trees;</l><ref type="line number">530</ref>
<l n="29.531">There he saw his tender mother,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.533">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.534">Felt rejoiced beyond all measure,</l>
<l n="29.535">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="29.536">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="29.537">"O my very dearest mother,</l>
<l n="29.538">O my mother who hast nursed me,</l>
<l n="29.539">Thou art living still, O mother,</l>

<l n="29.541">Yet I thought that thou had'st perished,</l>
<l n="29.542">And wast lost to me for ever,</l>
<l n="29.543">Perished underneath the sword-blades,</l>
<l n="29.544">Or beneath the spears had'st fallen,</l>
<l n="29.545">And I wept my pretty eyes out,</l>
<l n="29.546">And my handsome cheeks were ruined.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.547">Then said Lemminkainen's mother,</l>
<l n="29.548">"True it is that I am living,</l>
<l n="29.549">But was forced to fly my dwelling,</l>
<l n="29.550">And to seek a place of hiding</l><ref type="line number">550</ref>
<l n="29.551">In this dark and gloomy forest,</l>
<l n="29.552">In the most concealed recesses,</l>
<l n="29.553">When came Pohjola to battle,</l>
<l n="29.554">Murderous hosts from distant countries,</l>
<l n="29.555">Seeking but for thee, unhappy,</l>
<l n="29.556">And our home they laid in ruins,</l>
<l n="29.557">And they burned the house to ashes,</l>
<l n="29.558">And they wasted all the holding.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.559">Said the lively Lemminkainen:</l>
<l n="29.560">"O my mother who hast borne me,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
<l n="29.561">Do not give thyself to sadness,</l>
<l n="29.562">Be not sad, and be not troubled.</l>
<l n="29.563">We will now erect fresh buildings,</l>
<l n="29.564">Better buildings than the others,</l>
<l n="29.565">And will wage a war with Pohja,</l>
<l n="29.566">Overthrowing Lempo's people.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.567">Then did Lemminkainen's mother</l>
<l n="29.568">Answer in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="29.569">"Long hast thou, my son, been absent,</l>
<l n="29.570">Long, my Kauko, hast been living</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
<l n="29.571">In a distant foreign country,</l>

<l n="29.574">And upon an unknown island.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="29.575">Answered lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="29.576">Said the handsome Kaukomieli:</l>
<l n="29.577">"There to dwell was very pleasant,</l>
<l n="29.578">Charming was it there to wander.</l>

<head>LEMMINKAINEN AND TIERA</head>
<div type="argument">
Lemminkainen goes to ask his former comrade-in-arms, Tiera, to join him in an expedition against Pohjola (1-122). The Mistress of Pohjola sends the Frost against them, who freezes the boat in the sea, and almost freezes the heroes themselves in the boat, but that Lemminkainen restrains it by powerful charms and invocations (123-316). Lemminkainen and his companion walk across the ice to the shore, wander about in the waste for a long time in a miserable plight, and at last make their way home (317-500).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="30.001">Ahti, youth for ever youthful,</l>
<l n="30.002">Lemminkainen young and lively,</l>
<l n="30.003">Very early in the morning,</l>
<l n="30.004">In the very earliest morning,</l>
<l n="30.005">Sauntered downward to the boathouse,</l>
<l n="30.006">To the landing-stage he wandered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.007">There a wooden boat was weeping,</l>
<l n="30.008">Boat with iron rowlocks grieving;</l>
<l n="30.009">"Here am I, for sailing ready,</l>
<l n="30.010">But, O wretched one, rejected.</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="30.011">Ahti rows not forth to battle,</l>
<l n="30.012">For the space of sixty summers,</l>
<l n="30.013">Neither for the lust of silver,</l>
<l n="30.014">Or if need of gold should drive him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.015">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="30.016">Struck his glove upon the vessel,</l>
<l n="30.017">With his coloured glove he struck it,</l>
<l n="30.018">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="30.019">"Care thou not, O deck of pinewood,</l>
<l n="30.020">Nor lament, O timber-sided.</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>

<lg>
<l n="30.025">Then he went to seek his mother,</l>
<l n="30.026">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="30.027">"Do not weep for me, O mother,</l>
<l n="30.028">Nor lament, thou aged woman,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.035">To restrain him sought his mother,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.041">Little troubled Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="30.042">But he thought on his departure,</l>
<l n="30.043">And he started on his journey,</l>
<l n="30.044">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="30.045">"Can I find another hero,</l>
<l n="30.046">Find a man, and find a swordsman,</l>
<l n="30.047">Who will join in Ahti's battle,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.055">Through the villages he wandered,</l>
<l n="30.056">Found his way to Tiera's homestead,</l>
<l n="30.057">And he said on his arrival,</l>
<l n="30.058">Spoke the object of his coming:</l>

<l n="30.065">There was not a single village</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.081">From the window spoke the father,</l>
<l n="30.082">And the mother from the threshold,</l>
<l n="30.083">From the door the ruddy brothers,</l>
<l n="30.084">From the bridge-end spoke the sisters,</l>
<l n="30.085">"Tiera cannot go to battle,</l>
<l n="30.086">Nor may strike with spear in warfare.</l>
<l n="30.087">Other duties call for Tiera,</l>
<l n="30.088">He has made a lifelong compact,</l>
<l n="30.089">For a young wife has he taken</l>
<l n="30.090">As the mistress of his household,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="30.091">But untouched is she at present,</l>

<lg>
<l n="30.093">By the stove was Tiera resting,</l>
<l n="30.094">By the stove-side Kuura rested,</l>
<l n="30.095">At the stove one foot he booted,</l>
<l n="30.096">And the other at the stove-bench,</l>
<l n="30.097">At the gate his belt he tightened,</l>
<l n="30.098">In the open girt it round him;</l>
<l n="30.099">Then did Tiera grasp his spear-shaft,</l>
<l n="30.100">Not the largest of the largest,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="30.101">Nor the smallest of the smallest,</l>
<l n="30.102">But a spear of mid dimensions.</l>
<l n="30.103">On the blade a steed was standing,</l>
<l n="30.104">On the side a foal was trotting,</l>
<l n="30.105">At the joint a wolf was howling,</l>
<l n="30.106">At the haft a bear was growling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.107">Thus his spear did Tiera brandish,</l>
<l n="30.108">And he brandished it to whirring,</l>
<l n="30.109">Hurled it then to fathom-deepness</l>
<l n="30.110">In the stiff clay of the cornfield,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="30.111">In a bare spot of the meadow,</l>
<l n="30.112">In a flat spot free from hillocks.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.113">Then his spear was placed by Tiera</l>
<l n="30.114">With the other spears of Ahti,</l>
<l n="30.115">And he went and made him ready</l>
<l n="30.116">Swift to join in Ahti's battle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.117">Then did Ahti Saarelainen</l>

<l n="30.121">And he sailed away to north-west,</l>
<l n="30.122">On the lake that borders Pohja.</l>

<lg>
<l n="30.123">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>

<l n="30.146">And upon the waves he brooded.</l>
<l n="30.147">Forth he went, as he was ordered,</l>
<l n="30.148">And upon the land he wandered,</l>
<l n="30.149">Bit the leaves from off the branches,</l>
<l n="30.150">Grass from off the flowerless meadows.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.151">Then he came upon his journey</l>
<l n="30.152">To the lake that borders Pohja,</l>
<l n="30.153">To the endless waste of water,</l>
<l n="30.154">And upon the first night only</l>
<l n="30.155">Froze the bays and froze the lakelets,</l>
<l n="30.156">Hurried forward on the seashore,</l>
<l n="30.157">But the lake was still unfrozen,</l>
<l n="30.158">And the waves were still unstiffened.</l>
<l n="30.159">If a small finch swam the water,</l>
<l n="30.160">On the waves a water-wagtail,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>

<l n="30.162">And its little head unstiffened.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.163">On the second night, however,</l>
<l n="30.164">He began to work more strongly,</l>
<l n="30.165">Growing insolent extremely,</l>
<l n="30.166">And he now grew most terrific,</l>
<l n="30.167">Then the ice on ice he loaded,</l>
<l n="30.168">And the great Frost still was freezing,</l>
<l n="30.169">And with ice he clothed the mountains,</l>
<l n="30.170">Scattered snow to height of spear-shaft,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="30.171">Froze the boat upon the water,</l>
<l n="30.172">Ahti's vessel on the billows;</l>
<l n="30.173">Then he would have frozen Ahti,</l>
<l n="30.174">And in ice his feet would fasten,</l>
<l n="30.175">And he seized upon his fingers,</l>
<l n="30.176">And beneath his toes attacked him.</l>
<l n="30.177">Angry then was Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="30.178">Very angry and indignant,</l>
<l n="30.179">Pushed the Frost into the fire,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.181">With his hands the Frost then seized he,</l>

<l n="30.184">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="30.185">"Pakkanen, Puhuri's offspring,</l>
<l n="30.186">Thou, the son of cold of winter,</l>
<l n="30.187">Do not make my fingers frozen,</l>

<l n="30.215">Surely do I know thy lineage,</l>
<l n="30.216">All I know of thine uprearing;</l>
<l n="30.217">For the Frost was born 'mid willows,</l>
<l n="30.218">Nurtured in the sharpest weather,</l>
<l n="30.219">Near to Pohjola's great homestead,</l>
<l n="30.220">Near the hall of Pimentola,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="30.221">Sprung from father, ever crime-stained,</l>

<lg>
<l n="30.223">"Who was it the Frost who suckled,</l>

<l n="30.225">Milkless wholly was his mother,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.227">"Adders 'twas the Frost who suckled,</l>
<l n="30.228">Adders suckled, serpents fed him,</l>

<l n="30.230">Suckled with their dried-up udders,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="30.231">And the Northwind rocked his cradle,</l>
<l n="30.232">And to rest the cold air soothed him,</l>
<l n="30.233">In the wretched willow-thicket,</l>
<l n="30.234">In the midst of quaking marshes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.235">"And the boy was reared up vicious,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.255">"Now that thou hast grown to greatness,</l>

<l n="30.281">To the midst of coals of Hiisi,</l>
<l n="30.282">Even to the hearth of Lempo,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.299">Then the Frost, the son of Northwind,</l>
<l n="30.300">Felt that he was near destruction,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="30.301">Whereupon he prayed for mercy,</l>

<lg>
<l n="30.317">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="30.318">Left his vessel in the ice-floes,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="30.329">'Neath the cape there stood a castle,</l>

<head>UNTAMO AND KULLERVO</head>
<div type="argument">
Untamo wages war against his brother Kalervo, overthrows Kalervo and his army, sparing only a single pregnant woman of the whole clan. She is carried away to Untamo's people, and gives birth to her son Kullervo (1-82). Kullervo resolves in his cradle to take revenge on Untamo, and Untamo attempts several times to put him to death, but without success (83-202). When Kullervo grows up, he spoils all his work, and therefore Untamo sells him as a slave to Ilmarinen (203-374).

<l n="31.016">Bore the name of Untamoinen,</l>
<l n="31.017">For his father's lifelong anguish,</l>
<l n="31.018">And his mother's deep affliction.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.019">Untamoinen laid his netting</l>
<l n="31.020">Down in Kalervo's fish-waters:</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="31.021">Kalervoinen saw the netting,</l>
<l n="31.022">In his bag he put the fishes.</l>
<l n="31.023">Untamo of hasty temper</l>
<l n="31.024">Then became both vexed and angry,</l>
<l n="31.025">And his fingers turned to battle,</l>
<l n="31.026">With his open palms he urged it,</l>
<l n="31.027">Making strife for fishes' entrails,</l>
<l n="31.028">And for perch-fry made a quarrel.</l>

<lg>
<l n="31.029">Thus they fought and thus contended,</l>

<lg>
<l n="31.033">At another time it happened,</l>

<lg>
<l n="31.037">Sheep of Untamo most reckless</l>

<l n="31.040">Tore the sheep of Untamoinen.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.041">Untamo began to threaten</l>
<l n="31.042">Kalervo, his very brother;</l>
<l n="31.043">Kalervo's race vowed to slaughter,</l>
<l n="31.044">Smite the great, and smite the little,</l>
<l n="31.045">And to fall on all the people,</l>
<l n="31.046">And their houses burn to ashes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.047">Men with swords in belt he mustered,</l>

<l n="31.049">Little boys with spears in girdle,</l>
<l n="31.050">Handsome youths who shouldered axes,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="31.051">And he marched to furious battle,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.053">Kalervoinen's son's fair consort</l>
<l n="31.054">Then was sitting near the window,</l>
<l n="31.055">And she looked from out the window,</l>
<l n="31.056">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="31.057">"Is it smoke I see arising,</l>
<l n="31.058">Or a gloomy cloud that rises,</l>
<l n="31.059">On the borders of the cornfields,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.061">But no dark cloud there was rising,</l>
<l n="31.062">Nor was smoke ascending thickly,</l>
<l n="31.063">But 'twas Untamo's assemblage</l>
<l n="31.064">Marching onward to the battle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.065">On came Untamo's assemblage,</l>
<l n="31.066">In their belts their swords were hanging,</l>
<l n="31.067">Kalervo's folk overwhelming,</l>
<l n="31.068">And his mighty race they slaughtered,</l>
<l n="31.069">And they burned his house to ashes,</l>
<l n="31.070">Like a level field they made it.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.071">Left of Kalervo's folk only</l>
<l n="31.072">But one girl, and she was pregnant;</l>
<l n="31.073">Then did Untamo's assemblage</l>
<l n="31.074">Lead her homeward on their journey,</l>
<l n="31.075">That she there might sweep the chamber,</l>
<l n="31.076">And the floor might sweep from litter.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.077">But a little time passed over,</l>
<l n="31.078">When a little boy was born her,</l>
<l n="31.079">From a most unhappy mother,</l>
<l n="31.080">So by what name should they call him?</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="31.081">Kullervo his mother called him,</l>
<l n="31.082">Untamo, the Battle-hero.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.083">Then the little boy they swaddled,</l>
<l n="31.084">And the orphan child they rested</l>
<l n="31.085">In the cradle made for rocking,</l>
<l n="31.086">That it might be rocked to lull him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.087">So they rocked the child in cradle,</l>
<l n="31.088">Rocked it till his hair was tossing,</l>
<l n="31.089">Rocked him for one day, a second,</l>
<l n="31.090">Rocked him on the third day likewise,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="31.091">When the boy began his kicking,</l>
<l n="31.092">And he kicked and pushed about him,</l>
<l n="31.093">Tore his swaddling clothes to pieces,</l>
<l n="31.094">Freed himself from all his clothing,</l>
<l n="31.095">Then he broke the lime-wood cradle,</l>
<l n="31.096">All his rags he tore from off him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.097">And it seemed that he would prosper,</l>
<l n="31.098">And become a man of mettle.</l>
<l n="31.099">Untamola thought already</l>
<l n="31.100">That when he was grown to manhood,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="31.101">He would grow both wise and mighty,</l>
<l n="31.102">And become a famous hero,</l>
<l n="31.103">As a servant worth a hundred,</l>
<l n="31.104">Equal to a thousand servants.</l>
<l n="31.105">Thus he grew for two and three months,</l>
<l n="31.106">But already in the third month,</l>
<l n="31.107">When a boy no more than knee-high,</l>
<l n="31.108">He began to speak in thiswise:</l>
<l n="31.109">"Presently when I am bigger,</l>
<l n="31.110">And my body shall be stronger,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="31.111">I'll avenge my father's slaughter,</l>
<l n="31.112">And my mother's tears atone for."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.113">This was heard by Untamoinen,</l>
<l n="31.114">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="31.115">"He will bring my race to ruin,</l>
<l n="31.116">Kalervo reborn is in him."</l>
<l n="31.117">Thereupon the heroes pondered</l>
<l n="31.118">And the old crones all considered</l>
<l n="31.119">How to bring the boy to ruin,</l>
<l n="31.120">So that death might come upon him.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.121">Then they put him in a barrel,</l>
<l n="31.122">In a barrel did they thrust him,</l>
<l n="31.123">And they pushed it to the water,</l>
<l n="31.124">Pushed it out upon the billows.</l> <!--Like Bilbo barrel-rider!-->
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.125">Then they went to look about them,</l>
<l n="31.126">After two nights, after three nights,</l>
<l n="31.127">If the boy had sunk in water,</l>
<l n="31.128">Or had perished in the barrel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.129">In the waves he was not sunken,</l>
<l n="31.130">Nor had perished in the barrel,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="31.131">He had 'scaped from out the barrel,</l>
<l n="31.132">And upon the waves was sitting,</l>
<l n="31.133">In his hand a rod of copper,</l>
<l n="31.134">At the end a line all silken,</l>
<l n="31.135">And for lake-fish he was fishing,</l>
<l n="31.136">As he floated on the water.</l>
<l n="31.137">There was water in the lakelet,</l>
<l n="31.138">Which perchance might fill two ladles,</l>
<l n="31.139">Or if more exactly measured,</l>
<l n="31.140">Partly was a third filled also.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.141">Untamo again reflected,</l>
<l n="31.142">"How can we o'ercome the infant,</l>
<l n="31.143">That destruction come upon him,</l>
<l n="31.144">And that death may overtake him?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.145">Then he bade his servants gather</l>
<l n="31.146">First a large supply of birch-trees,</l>
<l n="31.147">Pine-trees with their hundred needles,</l>
<l n="31.148">Trees from which the pitch was oozing,</l>
<l n="31.149">For the burning of the infant,</l>
<l n="31.150">And for Kullervo's destruction.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.151">So they gathered and collected</l>
<l n="31.152">First a large supply of birch-trees,</l>
<l n="31.153">Pine-trees with their hundred needles,</l>
<l n="31.154">Trees from which the pitch was oozing,</l>
<l n="31.155">And of bark a thousand sledgefuls,</l>
<l n="31.156">Ash-trees, long a hundred fathoms.</l>
<l n="31.157">Fire beneath the wood they kindled,</l>
<l n="31.158">And the pyre began to crackle,</l>
<l n="31.159">And the boy they cast upon it,</l>
<l n="31.160">'Mid the glowing fire they cast him.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="31.161">Burned the fire a day, a second,</l>
<l n="31.162">Burning likewise on the third day,</l>
<l n="31.163">When they went to look about them.</l>
<l n="31.164">Knee-deep sat the boy in ashes,</l>
<l n="31.165">In the embers to his elbows.</l>
<l n="31.166">In his hand he held the coal-rake,</l>
<l n="31.167">And was stirring up the fire,</l>
<l n="31.168">And he raked the coals together.</l>
<l n="31.169">Not a hair was singed upon him,</l>
<l n="31.170">Not a lock was even tangled.</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.171">Then did Untamo grow angry.</l>
<l n="31.172">"Where then can I place the infant,</l>
<l n="31.173">That we bring him to destruction,</l>
<l n="31.174">And that death may overtake him?"</l>
<l n="31.175">So upon a tree they hanged him,</l>
<l n="31.176">Strung him up upon an oak-tree.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.177">Two nights and a third passed over,</l>
<l n="31.178">And upon the dawn thereafter,</l>
<l n="31.179">Untamo again reflected:</l>
<l n="31.180">"Time it is to look around us,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="31.181">Whether Kullervo has fallen,</l>
<l n="31.182">Or is dead upon the gallows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.183">Then he sent a servant forward,</l>
<l n="31.184">Back he came, and thus reported:</l>
<l n="31.185">"Kullervo not yet has perished,</l>
<l n="31.186">Nor has died upon the gallows.</l>
<l n="31.187">Pictures on the tree he's carving,</l>
<l n="31.188">In his hands he holds a graver.</l>
<l n="31.189">All the tree is filled with pictures,</l>
<l n="31.190">All the oak-tree filled with carvings;</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="31.191">Here are men, and here are sword-blades,</l>
<l n="31.192">And the spears are leaning by them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.193">Where should Untamo seek aidance,</l>
<l n="31.194">'Gainst this boy, the most unhappy?</l>
<l n="31.195">Whatsoever deaths he planned him,</l>
<l n="31.196">Or he planned for his destruction,</l>
<l n="31.197">In the jaws of death he fell not,</l>
<l n="31.198">Nor could he be brought to ruin.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.199">And at length he grew full weary</l>
<l n="31.200">Of his efforts to destroy him,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="31.201">So he reared up Kullervoinen</l>
<l n="31.202">As a slave beneath his orders.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.203">Thereupon said Untamoinen,</l>
<l n="31.204">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="31.205">"If you live as it is fitting,</l>
<l n="31.206">Always acting as is proper,</l>
<l n="31.207">In my house I will retain you,</l>
<l n="31.208">And the work of servants give you.</l>
<l n="31.209">I will pay you wages for it,</l>
<l n="31.210">As I think that you deserve it,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="31.211">For your waist a pretty girdle,</l>
<l n="31.212">Or upon your ear a buffet.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.213">So when Kullervo was taller,</l>
<l n="31.214">And had grown about a span-length,</l>
<l n="31.215">Then he found some work to give him,</l>
<l n="31.216">That he should prepare to labour.</l>
<l n="31.217">'Twas to rock a little infant,</l>
<l n="31.218">Rock a child with little fingers.</l>
<l n="31.219">"Watch with every care the infant,</l>
<l n="31.220">Give it food, and eat some also,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="31.221">Wash his napkins in the river,</l>
<l n="31.222">Wash his little clothes and cleanse them."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.223">So he watched one day, a second,</l>
<l n="31.224">Broke his hands, and gouged his eyes out,</l>
<l n="31.225">And at length upon the third day,</l>
<l n="31.226">Let the infant die of sickness,</l>
<l n="31.227">Cast the napkins in the river,</l>
<l n="31.228">And he burned the baby's cradle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.229">Untamo thereon reflected,</l>
<l n="31.230">"Such a one is quite unfitted</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="31.231">To attend to little children,</l>
<l n="31.232">Rock the babes with little fingers.</l>
<l n="31.233">Now I know not where to send him,</l>
<l n="31.234">Nor what work I ought to give him.</l>
<l n="31.235">Perhaps he ought to clear the forest?"</l>
<l n="31.236">So he went to clear the forest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.237">Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring</l>
<l n="31.238">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="31.239">"Now I first a man can deem me,</l>
<l n="31.240">When my hands the axe are wielding.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="31.241">I am handsomer to gaze on,</l>
<l n="31.242">Far more noble than aforetime,</l>
<l n="31.243">Five men's strength I feel within me</l>
<l n="31.244">And I equal six in valour."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.245">Then he went into the smithy,</l>
<l n="31.246">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="31.247">"O thou smith, my dearest brother,</l>
<l n="31.248">Forge me now a little hatchet,</l>
<l n="31.249">Such an axe as fits a hero,</l>
<l n="31.250">Iron tool for skilful workman,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="31.251">For I go to clear the forest,</l>
<l n="31.252">And to fell the slender birch-trees."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.253">So the smith forged what he needed,</l>
<l n="31.254">And an axe he forged him quickly;</l>
<l n="31.255">Such an axe as fits a hero,</l>
<l n="31.256">Iron tool for skilful workman.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.257">Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>
<l n="31.258">Set to work the axe to sharpen,</l>
<l n="31.259">And he ground it in the daytime,</l>
<l n="31.260">And at evening made a handle.</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.261">Then he went into the forest,</l>
<l n="31.262">High upon the wooded mountains,</l>
<l n="31.263">There to seek the best of planking,</l>
<l n="31.264">And to seek the best of timber.</l>
<l n="31.265">With his axe he smote the tree-trunks,</l>
<l n="31.266">With the blade of steel he felled them,</l>
<l n="31.267">At a stroke the best he severed,</l>
<l n="31.268">And the bad ones at a half-stroke.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.269">Five large trees at length had fallen,</l>
<l n="31.270">Eight in all he felled before him,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="31.271">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="31.272">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="31.273">"Lempo may the work accomplish,</l>
<l n="31.274">Hiisi now may shape the timber!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.275">In a stump he struck his axe-blade,</l>
<l n="31.276">And began to shout full loudly,</l>
<l n="31.277">And he piped, and then he whistled,</l>
<l n="31.278">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="31.279">"Let the wood be felled around me,</l>
<l n="31.280">Overthrown the slender birch-trees,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="31.281">Far as sounds my voice resounding,</l>
<l n="31.282">Far as I can send my whistle.</l>

<l n="31.314">Wattled them to make the fencing,</l>
<l n="31.315">Bound the branches fast together</l>
<l n="31.316">With the largest mountain-ashtrees;</l>
<l n="31.317">But he made the fence continuous,</l>
<l n="31.318">And he made no gateway through it,</l>
<l n="31.319">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>

<lg>
<l n="31.325">Then did Untamo determine</l>

<l n="31.345">Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>

<l n="31.349">Soon thereafter came the master,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.355">Untamoinen then was angry.</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="31.367">What then gave the smith in payment?</l>
<l n="31.368">Great the payment that he made him;</l>
<l n="31.369">For he gave two worn-out kettles,</l>
<l n="31.370">And three halves of hooks he gave him,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="31.371">And five worn-out scythes he gave him,</l>
<l n="31.372">And six worn-out rakes he gave him,</l>

<head>KULLERVO AND THE WIFE OF ILMARINEN</head>
<div type="argument">
The wife of Ilmarinen makes Kullervo her herdsman and maliciously bakes him a stone in his lunch (1-32). She then sends him out with the cattle, after using the usual prayers and charms for their protection from bears in the pastures (33-548).

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="32.013">Then the wife of Ilmarinen,</l>

<l n="32.015">What the new slave could accomplish,</l>
<l n="32.016">What the new-bought wretch could work at,</l>

<l n="32.020">She, the smith's wife, old and jeering,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="32.025">Then she spread the cake with butter,</l>

<head>THE DEATH OF ILMARINEN'S WIFE</head>
<div type="argument">
While Kullervo is in the pasture in the afternoon he tries to cut the cake with his knife which he completely spoils, and this goes to his heart the more because the knife was the only remembrance left to him of his family (1-98). To revenge himself on the mistress, he drives the cattle into the marshes to be devoured by beasts of the forest, and gathers together a herd of wolves and bears, which he drives home in the evening (99-184). When the mistress goes to milk them she is torn to pieces by the wild beasts (185-296).

<l n="34.021">To the lane he went to listen,</l>
<l n="34.022">To the yard to look around him,</l>
<l n="34.023">Who was playing in the forest,</l>
<l n="34.024">And upon the heath was piping.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.025">Then he saw what just had happened,</l>
<l n="34.026">Saw the truth without deception,</l>
<l n="34.027">There he saw his wife was resting,</l>
<l n="34.028">Saw the fair one who had perished,</l>
<l n="34.029">Where she in the yard had fallen,</l>
<l n="34.030">On the grass where she had fallen.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.031">Even while the smith was standing,</l>
<l n="34.032">All his heart was dark with sorrow;</l>
<l n="34.033">Many nights he spent in weeping,</l>
<l n="34.034">Many weeks his tears were flowing,</l>
<l n="34.035">And his soul like tar was darkened,</l>
<l n="34.036">And his heart than soot no lighter.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.037">Kullervo still wandered onwards,</l>
<l n="34.038">Aimlessly he hurried forward,</l>
<l n="34.039">For a day through thickest forest,</l>
<l n="34.040">Through the timber-grounds of Hiisi,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="34.041">And at evening, when it darkened,</l>
<l n="34.042">Down upon the ground he threw him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.043">There the orphan boy was sitting,</l>
<l n="34.044">And the friendless one reflected:</l>
<l n="34.045">"Wherefore have I been created,</l>
<l n="34.046">Who has made me, and has doomed me,</l>
<l n="34.047">Thus 'neath moon and sun to wander</l>

<l n="34.050">And may travel to their dwellings,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="34.051">But my home is in the forest,</l>
<l n="34.052">And upon the heath my homestead.</l>

<lg>
<l n="34.055">"Never, Jumala most gracious,</l>
<l n="34.056">Never in the course of ages,</l>

<l n="34.061">As thou, Jumala, hast made me,</l>

<lg>
<l n="34.071">"Now I know not who has nursed me,</l>
<l n="34.072">And I know not who has borne me,</l>
<l n="34.073">For, as water-hens are used to,</l>
<l n="34.074">Or as ducks among the marshes,</l>
<l n="34.075">Like the teal on shore she left me,</l>
<l n="34.076">Or in hollow stone, merganser.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.077">"I was small, and lost my father,</l>
<l n="34.078">I was weak, and lost my mother,</l>

<l n="34.080">All my mighty race has perished,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="34.081">Shoes of ice to wear they left me,</l>

<l n="34.084">Rolling on the platform left me,</l>
<l n="34.085">Thus I fell into the marshes,</l>
<l n="34.086">And amid the mud was swallowed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.087">"But in all my life I never,</l>
<l n="34.088">Never in my life I hastened,</l>

<l n="34.090">Or a bridge in marshy places;</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="34.091">But I sank not in the marshes,</l>
<l n="34.092">For I had two hands to help me,</l>

<l n="34.094">And ten nails to lift me from it."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.095">Then into his mind it entered</l>
<l n="34.096">In his brain he fixed the notion</l>
<l n="34.097">Unto Untamo to journey,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.101">Then he spoke the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.107">Then an old dame came to meet him,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="34.113">Kullervo, Kalervo's offspring,</l>

<l n="34.171">Till at length he found the river,</l>
<l n="34.172">And he marched along the river,</l>

<head>KULLERVO AND HIS SISTER</head>
<div type="argument">
Kullervo attempts to do different kinds of work for his parents, but only succeeds in spoiling everything, so his father sends him to pay the land-dues (1-68). On his way home he meets his sister who was lost gathering berries, whom he drags into his sledge (69-188). Afterwards, when his sister learns who he is, she throws herself into a torrent, but Kullervo hurries home, relates his sister's terrible fate to his mother, and proposes to put an end to his own life (189-344). His mother dissuades him from suicide, and advises him to retire to some retreat where he may be able to recover from his remorse. But Kullervo resolves before all things to avenge himself on Untamo (345-372).

<l n="35.006">Nor attained to manly wisdom,</l>
<l n="35.007">For his rearing had been crooked,</l>

<head>THE DEATH OF KULLERVO</head>
<div type="argument">
Kullervo prepares for war and leaves home joyfully, for no one but his mother is sorry that he is going to his death (1-154). He comes to Untamola, lays waste the whole district, and burns the homestead (155-250). On returning home he finds his home deserted, and no living thing about the place but an old black dog, with which he goes into the forest to shoot game for food (251-296). While traversing the forest he arrives at the place where he met his sister, and ends his remorse by killing himself with his own sword (297-360).

<head>THE GOLD AND SILVER BRIDE</head>
<div type="argument">
Ilmarinen weeps long for his dead wife and then forges himself a wife of gold and silver with great labour and trouble (1-162). At night he rests by the golden bride, but finds in the morning that the side which he has turned towards her is quite cold (163-196). He offers his golden bride to Väinämöinen, who declines to receive her, and advises him to forge more useful things, or to send her to other countries where people wish for gold (197-250).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="37.001">Afterwards smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="37.002">Mourned his wife throughout the evenings,</l>
<l n="37.003">And through sleepless nights was weeping,</l>
<l n="37.004">All the days bewailed her fasting,</l>
<l n="37.005">And he mourned her all the mornings,</l>
<l n="37.006">In the morning hours lamented,</l>
<l n="37.007">Since the time his young wife perished,</l>
<l n="37.008">Death the fair one had o'ertaken.</l>
<l n="37.009">In his hand he swung no longer,</l>
<l n="37.010">Copper handle of his hammer,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="37.011">Nor his hammer's clang resounded,</l>
<l n="37.012">While a month its course was running.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.013">Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="37.014">"Hapless youth, I know no longer,</l>
<l n="37.015">How to pass my sad existence,</l>
<l n="37.016">For at night I sit and sleep not,</l>
<l n="37.017">Always in the night comes sorrow,</l>
<l n="37.018">And my strength grows weak from trouble.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.019">"All my evenings now are weary,</l>
<l n="37.020">Sorrowful are all my mornings,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="37.021">And the nights indeed are dismal,</l>
<l n="37.022">Worst of all when I am waking.</l>
<l n="37.023">Grieve I not because 'tis evening,</l>
<l n="37.024">Sorrow not because 'tis morning,</l>
<l n="37.025">Trouble not for other seasons;</l>
<l n="37.026">But I sorrow for my fair one,</l>
<l n="37.027">And I sorrow for my dear one,</l>
<l n="37.028">Grieve for her, the dark-browed beauty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.029">"Sometimes in these times so dismal,</l>
<l n="37.030">Often in my time of trouble,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="37.031">Often in my dreams at midnight,</l>
<l n="37.032">Has my hand felt out at nothing,</l>
<l n="37.033">And my hand seized only trouble,</l>
<l n="37.034">As it strayed about in strangeness.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.035">Thus the smith awhile lived wifeless,</l>
<l n="37.036">And without his wife grew older,</l>
<l n="37.037">Wept for two months and for three months,</l>
<l n="37.038">But upon the fourth month after,</l>
<l n="37.039">Gold from out the lake he gathered,</l>
<l n="37.040">Gathered silver from the billows,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="37.041">And a pile of wood collected,</l>
<l n="37.042">Nothing short of thirty sledgeloads,</l>
<l n="37.043">Then he burned the wood to charcoal,</l>
<l n="37.044">Took the charcoal to the smithy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.045">Of the gold he took a portion,</l>
<l n="37.046">And he chose him out some silver,</l>
<l n="37.047">Even like a ewe of autumn,</l>
<l n="37.048">Even like a hare of winter,</l>
<l n="37.049">And the gold to redness heated,</l>
<l n="37.050">Cast the silver in the furnace,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="37.051">Set his slaves to work the bellows,</l>

<l n="37.066">For a third time worked the bellows,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.071">Then a ewe rose from the furnace,</l>

<l n="37.073">One hair gold, another copper,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="37.189">And one side had warmth sufficient</l>

<l n="37.191">That beside the youthful damsel,</l>

<lg>
<l n="37.197">Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>

<lg>
<l n="37.217">Said the smith, said Ilmarinen,</l>

<head>ILMARINEN'S NEW BRIDE FROM POHJOLA</head>
<div type="argument">
Ilmarinen goes to Pohjola to woo the younger sister of his first wife, but as he receives only insulting words in reply, he becomes angry, seizes the maiden, and starts on his homeward journey (1-124). On the way the maiden treats Ilmarinen with contempt, and provokes him till he changes her into a seagull (125-286). When Ilmarinen comes home, he relates to Väinämöinen how the inhabitants of Pohjola live free from care since they possessed the Sampo; and also tells him how badly his wooing has prospered (287-328).

<l n="38.049">When to thee my child I promised,</l>

<l n="38.087">Neither in his mouth so subtle,</l>
<l n="38.088">Neither in his feet well-shapen,</l>
<l n="38.089">For his gums are like a wolf's gums,</l>
<l n="38.090">Curved his claws like those of foxes,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>

Väinämöinen persuades Ilmarinen to go with him to Pohjola to bring away the Sampo. Ilmarinen consents, and the heroes start off on their journey in a boat (1-330).

<lg>
<l n="39.041">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="39.042">"Safest is by land the journey,</l>
<l n="39.043">Safest, but the most fatiguing,</l>
<l n="39.044">And moreover, full of windings.</l>
<l n="39.045">Pleasant 'tis in boat on water,</l>
<l n="39.046">Swaying as the boat glides onward,</l>
<l n="39.047">Gliding o'er the sparkling water,</l>
<l n="39.048">Driving o'er its shining surface,</l>
<l n="39.049">While the wind the boat is rocking,</l>
<l n="39.050">And the waves drive on the vessel,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="39.051">While the west-wind rocks it gently,</l>
<l n="39.052">And the south-wind drives it onward,</l>
<l n="39.053">But let this be as it may be,</l>
<l n="39.054">If you do not like the lake-voyage,</l>
<l n="39.055">We by land can journey thither,</l>
<l n="39.056">And along the shore can journey.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.057">"First a new sword do you forge me,</l>
<l n="39.058">Make me now a keen-edged weapon,</l>
<l n="39.059">So that I with beasts can struggle,</l>
<l n="39.060">Chase away the folks of Pohja.</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="39.061">Forth I go to seize the Sampo,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.065">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="39.066">He the great primeval craftsman,</l>
<l n="39.067">Cast some iron in the fire,</l>
<l n="39.068">Steel upon the glowing charcoal,</l>
<l n="39.069">And of gold he took a handful,</l>
<l n="39.070">And of silver took a handful,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="39.071">Set the slaves to work the bellows,</l>
<l n="39.072">And he made the labourers press them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.073">Worked the slaves the bellows strongly,</l>
<l n="39.074">Well the labourers pressed the bellows,</l>
<l n="39.075">Till like soup spread out the iron,</l>
<l n="39.076">And like dough the steel was yielding,</l>
<l n="39.077">And the silver shone like water,</l>
<l n="39.078">And the gold swelled up like billows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.079">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="39.080">He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="39.081">Stooped to look into the furnace,</l>
<l n="39.082">At the edges of the bellows,</l>
<l n="39.083">And he saw a sword was forming,</l>
<l n="39.084">With a hilt of gold constructed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.085">From the fire he took the weapon,</l>
<l n="39.086">Took the work so finely fashioned,</l>
<l n="39.087">From the furnace to the anvil,</l>
<l n="39.088">To the hammer and the mallet,</l>
<l n="39.089">Forged the sword as he would wish it,</l>
<l n="39.090">And a blade the best of any,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="39.091">And with finest gold inlaid it,</l>
<l n="39.092">And with silver he adorned it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.093">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="39.094">Entered then to view the weapon,</l>
<l n="39.095">And he found a keen-edged sword-blade.</l>
<l n="39.096">Straightway in his hand he raised it,</l>
<l n="39.097">And he turned it and surveyed it,</l>
<l n="39.098">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.099">"Does this sword befit a hero,</l>
<l n="39.100">Is the sword to bearer suited?"</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="39.101">And the sword the hero suited.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.102">Well did it befit the bearer.</l>
<l n="39.103">On its point the moon was shining,</l>
<l n="39.104">On its side the sun was shining,</l>
<l n="39.105">On the haft the stars were gleaming,</l>
<l n="39.106">At the tip a horse was neighing,</l>
<l n="39.107">On the knob a cat was mewing,</l>
<l n="39.108">On the sheath a dog was barking.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.109">After this the sword he brandished,</l>
<l n="39.110">And he cleft an iron mountain,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="39.111">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.112">"Thus, with such a blade as this is,</l>
<l n="39.113">Can I cleave the mountains open,</l>
<l n="39.114">Cleave the rocky hills asunder.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.115">After this did Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="39.116">Speak aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.117">"How shall I myself, unhappy,</l>
<l n="39.118">How shall I, the weak, defend me,</l>
<l n="39.119">And shall armour me, and belt me,</l>
<l n="39.120">'Gainst the risks of land and water?</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="39.121">Shall I clothe myself in armour,</l>
<l n="39.122">In a coat of mail the strongest,</l>
<l n="39.123">Gird a belt of steel around me?</l>
<l n="39.124">Stronger is a man in armour,</l>
<l n="39.125">In a coat of mail is better,</l>
<l n="39.126">With a belt of steel more mighty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.127">Then arrived the time for starting,</l>
<l n="39.128">And preparing for departure;</l>
<l n="39.129">First the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="39.130">Secondly smith Ilmarinen,</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="39.131">And they went to seek the courser,</l>
<l n="39.132">And to find the yellow-maned one,</l>
<l n="39.133">And the one-year old to bridle,</l>
<l n="39.134">And to see the foal was rough-shod.</l>
<l n="39.135">Then they went to seek the courser,</l>
<l n="39.136">Went to seek him in the forest,</l>
<l n="39.137">And they gazed around them keenly,</l>
<l n="39.138">And they sought around the blue wood,</l>
<l n="39.139">Found the horse among the bushes,</l>
<l n="39.140">Found the yellow-maned in firwood.</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.141">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="39.142">Secondly smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="39.143">On his head the bit adjusted,</l>
<l n="39.144">And the one-year old they bridled,</l>
<l n="39.145">And they drove upon their journey.</l>
<l n="39.146">On the shore drove both the heroes,</l>
<l n="39.147">On the shore they heard lamenting,</l>
<l n="39.148">From the haven heard complaining.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.149">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="39.150">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="39.151">"Perhaps it is a girl complaining,</l>
<l n="39.152">Or perchance a dove lamenting.</l>
<l n="39.153">Shall we go to look about us,</l>
<l n="39.154">Shall we nearer go to listen?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.155">Therefore to the spot they sauntered,</l>
<l n="39.156">Nearer went to gaze around them,</l>
<l n="39.157">But no maiden there was weeping,</l>
<l n="39.158">And no dove was there lamenting,</l>
<l n="39.159">But they found a vessel weeping,</l>
<l n="39.160">And a boat was there lamenting.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.161">Said the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="39.162">As he went towards the vessel,</l>
<l n="39.163">"Wherefore weep, O wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.164">Boat with rowlocks, why lamentest?</l>
<l n="39.165">Dost thou weep that thou art clumsy,</l>
<l n="39.166">And art dreaming at thy moorings?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.167">Then the wooden boat made answer,</l>
<l n="39.168">Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l>
<l n="39.169">"Know, a vessel longs for water,</l>
<l n="39.170">And its tarry sides desire it,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="39.171">As a maiden may be longing</l>
<l n="39.172">For the fine home of a husband.</l>
<l n="39.173">Therefore weeps the boat unhappy,</l>
<l n="39.174">And the hapless boat lamenteth,</l>
<l n="39.175">And I weep to speed through water,</l>
<l n="39.176">And to float upon the billows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.177">"It was said when I was fashioned,</l>
<l n="39.178">When my boards were sung together,</l>
<l n="39.179">That I should become a warship,</l>
<l n="39.180">And should be employed for warboat,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="39.181">And should bear the plunder homeward,</l>
<l n="39.182">In my hold should carry treasure,</l>
<l n="39.183">But I have not been in battle,</l>
<l n="39.184">Neither have been stored with plunder.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.185">"Other boats, and even bad ones,</l>
<l n="39.186">Always wander forth to battle,</l>
<l n="39.187">And are led to battle-struggle</l>
<l n="39.188">Three times in the course of summer,</l>
<l n="39.189">And return with money loaded,</l>
<l n="39.190">In their hold they carry treasure,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="39.191">But for me, though well constructed,</l>
<l n="39.192">Of a hundred boards constructed,</l>
<l n="39.193">Here upon my rests I'm rotting,</l>
<l n="39.194">Lying idly at my moorings,</l>
<l n="39.195">And the worst worms of the country</l>
<l n="39.196">Underneath my ribs are lurking,</l>
<l n="39.197">While the birds, of all most horrid,</l>
<l n="39.198">In my masts their nests are building,</l>
<l n="39.199">All the toads from out the forest</l>
<l n="39.200">Over all my deck are leaping.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="39.201">Twice it had been better for me,</l>
<l n="39.202">Two or three times were it better</l>
<l n="39.203">Had I been a mountain pine-tree,</l>
<l n="39.204">Or upon the heath a fir-tree,</l>
<l n="39.205">With a squirrel in my branches,</l>
<l n="39.206">Underneath my boughs a puppy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.207">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="39.208">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.209">"Do not weep, O wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.210">Fret thyself, O boat with rowlocks!</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="39.211">Soon shalt thou go forth to battle,</l>
<l n="39.212">There to mix in furious conflict.</l>
<l n="39.213">Boat, who wast by builder fashioned,</l>
<l n="39.214">'Twas this gift the builder gave thee,</l>
<l n="39.215">That thy prow should reach the water,</l>
<l n="39.216">And thy sides the billows traverse,</l>
<l n="39.217">Even though no hand should touch thee,</l>
<l n="39.218">Neither arm be thrust against thee,</l>
<l n="39.219">Though no shoulder should direct thee,</l>
<l n="39.220">And although no arm should guide thee."</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.221">Then replied the wooden vessel,</l>

<l n="39.223">"None of all my race so mighty,</l>
<l n="39.224">Neither will the boats, my brothers,</l>
<l n="39.225">Move unpushed into the water,</l>
<l n="39.226">Nor unrowed upon the billows,</l>
<l n="39.227">If no hand is laid upon us,</l>
<l n="39.228">And no arm should urge us forward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.229">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="39.230">"If I push you in the water,</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="39.231">Will you make, unrowed, your journey,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.235">Answer made the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.236">Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l>
<l n="39.237">"None of all my race so noble,</l>
<l n="39.238">Nor the host of other vessels,</l>
<l n="39.239">Speed along unrowed by fingers,</l>

<l n="39.241">By the rudder undirected,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.243">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="39.244">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.245">"Can you speed if some one rows you,</l>
<l n="39.246">If assisted by the oars,</l>
<l n="39.247">By the rudder if directed,</l>
<l n="39.248">When the sails the breeze is filling?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.249">Answered then the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.250">Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="39.251">"Yes, my race would hasten onward,</l>
<l n="39.252">All the other boats my brothers,</l>

<l n="39.254">If assisted by the oars,</l>
<l n="39.255">By the rudder if directed,</l>
<l n="39.256">When the sails the breeze is filling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.257">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="39.258">Left his horse upon the sandhills,</l>
<l n="39.259">On a tree he fixed the halter,</l>
<l n="39.260">Tied the reins upon the branches,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="39.261">Pushed the boat into the water,</l>
<l n="39.262">Sang the vessel in the billows,</l>
<l n="39.263">And he asked the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.264">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.265">"O thou boat, of shape so curving,</l>
<l n="39.266">O thou wooden boat with rowlocks,</l>
<l n="39.267">Art thou just as fit to bear us,</l>
<l n="39.268">As thyself art fair to gaze on?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.269">Answered thus the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.270">Thus replied the boat with rowlocks:</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="39.271">"I am fitted well to bear you,</l>

<lg>
<l n="39.275">So the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="39.276">Softly then began to carol,</l>
<l n="39.277">Sang on one side of the vessel</l>
<l n="39.278">Handsome youths, with hair brushed smoothly,</l>
<l n="39.279">Hair smoothed down and hands all hardened,</l>
<l n="39.280">And their feet were finely booted;</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="39.281">Sang on other side of vessel</l>
<l n="39.282">Girls with tin upon their head-dress,</l>
<l n="39.283">Head-dress tin, and belts of copper,</l>
<l n="39.284">Golden rings upon their fingers;</l>
<l n="39.285">And again sang Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="39.286">Till the seats were full of people,</l>
<l n="39.287">Some were very aged people,</l>
<l n="39.288">Men whose lives were nearly over,</l>
<l n="39.289">But for these the space was scanty,</l>
<l n="39.290">For the young folks came before them.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.291">In the stern himself he seated,</l>
<l n="39.292">Sat behind the birchwood vessel,</l>
<l n="39.293">And he steered the vessel onward,</l>
<l n="39.294">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="39.295">"Speed thou on through treeless regions,</l>
<l n="39.296">O'er the wide expanse of water,</l>
<l n="39.297">O'er the lake do thou float lightly,</l>
<l n="39.298">As on waves a water-lily.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.299">Then he set the youths to rowing,</l>

<l n="39.301">Rowed the youths, and bent the oars,</l>

<l n="39.306">Yet the vessel moved not onward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.307">Then the old folks set to rowing,</l>
<l n="39.308">While the young folks gazed upon them;</l>
<l n="39.309">Rowed they till their heads were shaking,</l>
<l n="39.310">Still the vessel moved not onward.</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>

<lg>
<l n="39.311">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="39.312">Sat him down, and set to rowing;</l>
<l n="39.313">Now moved on the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="39.314">Sped the boat and made good progress,</l>
<l n="39.315">Far was heard the splash of oars,</l>
<l n="39.316">Far the splashing of the rudder.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.317">On he rowed, while splashed the water,</l>
<l n="39.318">Cracked the seats, and shook the planking,</l>
<l n="39.319">Clashed the mountain-ashwood oars,</l>
<l n="39.320">Creaked like hazel-grouse the rudders,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="39.321">And their tips like cry of blackcock.</l>
<l n="39.322">Like a swan the prow clove onward,</l>

<lg>
<l n="39.325">And the aged Väinämöinen</l>

<l n="39.328">With the aid of the strong rudder,</l>
<l n="39.329">Till they saw a cliff before them,</l>

<l n="39.361">Then with all his might he shouted,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="39.367">From the boat the men made answer,</l>

<lg>
<l n="39.421">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<head>THE PIKE AND THE KANTELE</head>
<div type="argument">
The Sampo-raiders come to a waterfall, beneath which the boat is caught fast on the back of a great pike (1-94). The pike is killed, and the front part is taken into the boat, cooked, and eaten (94-204). Väinämöinen makes the jaws of the pike into a kantele, on which several of the party attempt to play, but without success (205-342).

<l n="40.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN'S MUSIC</head>
<div type="argument">
Väinämöinen plays on the kantele, and all living things, whether belonging to the air, earth, or water, hasten to the spot to listen (1-168). The hearts of all listeners are so affected by the music that tears fall from their eyes, and Väinämöinen's own eyes shed large drops which fall to the ground and trickle into the water, where they are changed into beautiful blue pearls (169-266).

<l n="41.008">From a golden heath arising.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="41.009">Then the harp he grasped with fingers,</l>

<l n="41.014">Ye before who never heard me,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="41.017">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<l n="41.028">And he lifted up the fish-tail,</l>

<lg>
<l n="41.217">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="41.218">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="41.225">And the young folks gave him answer,</l>
<l n="41.226">And the old folks likewise answered:</l>

<l n="41.236">And the tears again can gather,</l>
<l n="41.237">From beneath the sparkling waters,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="41.245">And the blue duck heard him likewise,</l>
<l n="41.246">And the blue duck next came forward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="41.247">Said the aged Väinämöinen:</l>

<l n="41.261">But they were transformed already,</l>

<head>THE CAPTURE OF THE SAMPO</head>
<div type="argument">
The heroes arrive at Pohjola, and Väinämöinen announces that he has come to take possession of the Sampo, either with good-will, or by force (1-58). The Mistress of Pohjola refuses to yield it either by consent or by compulsion, and calls together her people to oppose him (59-64). Väinämöinen takes the kantele, begins to play, and lulls to sleep all the people of Pohjola, and goes with his companions to search for the Sampo; they take it from the stone mountain and convey it to the boat (65-164). They sail homewards well satisfied, carrying the Sampo with them (165-308). On the third day the Mistress of Pohjola wakes from her sleep, and when she finds that the Sampo has been carried off, she prepares a thick fog, a strong wind, and other impediments, to oppose the robbers of the Sampo, which reach the vessel, and during the tempest Väinämöinen's kantele falls into the water (309-562).

<l n="42.131">"O, I am a man of mettle,</l>
<l n="42.132">And a hero-son of Ukko!</l>
<l n="42.133">I can surely move the Sampo,</l>

<l n="42.135">Standing on my right foot only,</l>
<l n="42.136">If I touch it with my shoe-heel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.137">Lemminkainen pushed against it,</l>
<l n="42.138">Turned himself, and pushed against it,</l>
<l n="42.139">Pushed his arms and breast against it,</l>

<l n="42.141">But he could not move the Sampo,</l>

<l n="42.143">For the roots were rooted firmly</l>
<l n="42.144">In the depths nine fathoms under.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.145">There was then a bull in Pohja,</l>

<l n="42.153">Up they ploughed the roots of Sampo,</l>

<l n="42.191">Sailed away in great contentment,</l>
<l n="42.192">Joyous to his native country,</l>

<l n="42.260">Straight the course that now we follow."</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.261">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="42.262">Gave him a decided answer:</l>
<l n="42.263">"'Tis too early yet for singing,</l>
<l n="42.264">'Tis too early for rejoicing.</l>
<l n="42.265">Soon a time will come for singing,</l>
<l n="42.266">Fitting time for our rejoicing,</l>
<l n="42.267">When we see our doors before us,</l>
<l n="42.268">And we hear our own doors creaking.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.269">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="42.270">"In the stern I'll take position,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="42.271">And with all my might will sing there,</l>
<l n="42.272">And with all my force will bellow.</l>
<l n="42.273">Perhaps indeed I cannot do so,</l>
<l n="42.274">Loud enough I cannot bellow:</l>
<l n="42.275">If you will not sing unto us,</l>
<l n="42.276">Then will I commence the singing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.277">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="42.278">He the handsome Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="42.279">Quickly pursed his mouth for singing,</l>
<l n="42.280">And prepared himself to carol,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="42.281">And began to sing his carols,</l>
<l n="42.282">But his songs were most discordant,</l>
<l n="42.283">And his voice it sounded hoarsely,</l>
<l n="42.284">And his tones were most discordant.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.285">Sang the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="42.286">Shouted loudly Kaukomieli,</l>
<l n="42.287">Moved his mouth, his beard was wagging,</l>
<l n="42.288">And his chin was likewise shaking.</l>
<l n="42.289">Far away was heard his singing,</l>
<l n="42.290">Far away across the water,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="42.291">In six villages they heard it,</l>
<l n="42.292">Over seven the song resounded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.293">On a stump a crane was sitting,</l>
<l n="42.294">On a mound from swamp arising,</l>
<l n="42.295">And his toe-bones he was counting,</l>
<l n="42.296">And his feet he was uplifting,</l>
<l n="42.297">And was terrified extremely</l>
<l n="42.298">At the song of Lemminkainen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.299">Left the crane his strange employment,</l>
<l n="42.300">With his harsh voice screamed in terror,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="42.301">From his perch he flew in terror,</l>
<l n="42.302">Over Pohjola in terror,</l>
<l n="42.303">And upon his coming thither,</l>
<l n="42.304">When he reached the swamp of Pohja,</l>
<l n="42.305">Screaming still, and screaming harshly,</l>
<l n="42.306">Screaming at his very loudest,</l>
<l n="42.307">Waked in Pohjola the people,</l>
<l n="42.308">And aroused that evil nation.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.309">Up rose Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="42.310">From her long and heavy slumber,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="42.311">And she hastened to the farmyard,</l>
<l n="42.312">Ran to where the corn was drying,</l>
<l n="42.313">And she looked upon the cattle,</l>
<l n="42.314">And the corn in haste examined.</l>
<l n="42.315">Nought was missing from the cattle,</l>
<l n="42.316">And the corn had not been plundered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.317">To the hill of stone she wandered,</l>
<l n="42.318">And the copper mountain's entrance,</l>
<l n="42.319">And she said as she was coming,</l>
<l n="42.320">"Woe to me, this day unhappy,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="42.321">For a stranger here has entered,</l>
<l n="42.322">And the locks have all been opened,</l>
<l n="42.323">And the castle's doors been opened,</l>
<l n="42.324">And the iron hinges broken.</l>
<l n="42.325">Has the Sampo perhaps been stolen,</l>
<l n="42.326">And the whole been taken from us?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.327">Yes, the Sampo had been taken,</l>
<l n="42.328">Carried off the pictured cover,</l>
<l n="42.329">Forth from Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
<l n="42.330">From within the hill of copper,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="42.331">Though by ninefold locks protected,</l>
<l n="42.332">Though ten bars protected likewise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.333">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="42.334">Fell into the greatest fury,</l>
<l n="42.335">But she felt her strength was failing,</l>
<l n="42.336">And her power had all departed,</l>
<l n="42.337">So she prayed to the Cloud-Maiden.</l>
<l n="42.338">"Maiden of the Clouds, Mist-Maiden,</l>
<l n="42.339">Scatter from thy sieve the cloudlets,</l>
<l n="42.340">And the mists around thee scatter,</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="42.341">Send the thick clouds down from heaven,</l>
<l n="42.342">Sink thou from the air of vapour,</l>
<l n="42.343">O'er the broad lake's shining surface,</l>
<l n="42.344">Out upon the open water,</l>
<l n="42.345">On the head of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="42.346">Falling on Uvantolainen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.347">"But if this is not sufficient,</l>
<l n="42.348">Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
<l n="42.349">Lift thy head from out the water,</l>
<l n="42.350">Raise thy head above the billows,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>
<l n="42.351">Crush thou Kaleva's vile children,</l>
<l n="42.352">Sink thou down Uvantolainen,</l>
<l n="42.353">Sink thou down the wicked heroes</l>
<l n="42.354">In the depths beneath the billows,</l>
<l n="42.355">Bring to Pohjola the Sampo,</l>
<l n="42.356">Let it fall not from the vessel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.357">"But if this is not sufficient,</l>
<l n="42.358">Ukko, thou, of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="42.359">Golden king in airy regions,</l>
<l n="42.360">Mighty one, adorned with silver,</l><ref type="line number">360</ref>
<l n="42.361">Let the air be filled with tempest,</l>
<l n="42.362">Raise a mighty wind against them,</l>
<l n="42.363">Raise thou winds and waves against them,</l>
<l n="42.364">With their boat contending ever,</l>
<l n="42.365">Falling on the head of Väinö,</l>
<l n="42.366">Rushing on Uvantolainen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.367">Then the Maid of Clouds, Mist-Maiden,</l>
<l n="42.368">From the lake a cloud breathed upward,</l>
<l n="42.369">Through the air the cloud she scattered,</l>
<l n="42.370">And detained old Väinämöinen,</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="42.371">And for three whole nights she kept him</l>
<l n="42.372">Out upon the lake's blue surface,</l>
<l n="42.373">And he could not move beyond it,</l>
<l n="42.374">Nor could he escape beyond it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.375">When for three nights he had rested</l>
<l n="42.376">Out upon the lake's blue surface,</l>
<l n="42.377">Spoke the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="42.378">And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
<l n="42.379">"There's no man, how weak soever,</l>
<l n="42.380">Not among the laziest heroes,</l><ref type="line number">380</ref>
<l n="42.381">Who by clouds would thus be hindered,</l>
<l n="42.382">And by mists would thus be worsted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.383">With his sword he clove the water,</l>
<l n="42.384">In the lake his sword plunged deeply,</l>
<l n="42.385">Mead along his blade was flowing,</l>
<l n="42.386">Honey from his sword was dropping.</l>
<l n="42.387">Then the fog to heaven ascended,</l>
<l n="42.388">And the cloud in air rose upward,</l>
<l n="42.389">From the lake the mist ascended,</l>
<l n="42.390">And the vapour from the lake-waves,</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
<l n="42.391">And the lake extended widely,</l>
<l n="42.392">Wider spread the whole horizon.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.393">But a little time passed over,</l>
<l n="42.394">Short the time that then passed over,</l>
<l n="42.395">When they heard a mighty roaring,</l>
<l n="42.396">At the red boat's side they heard it,</l>
<l n="42.397">And the foam flew wildly upwards,</l>
<l n="42.398">Near the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.399">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="42.400">Felt the very greatest terror.</l><ref type="line number">400</ref>
<l n="42.401">From his cheeks the blood departed,</l>
<l n="42.402">From his cheeks the ruddy colour;</l>
<l n="42.403">O'er his head he drew his felt-cap,</l>
<l n="42.404">And above his ears he drew it,</l>
<l n="42.405">And his cheeks with care he covered,</l>
<l n="42.406">And his eyes he covered better.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.407">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="42.408">Looked into the water round him,</l>
<l n="42.409">Cast his gaze beside the vessel,</l>
<l n="42.410">And he saw a little wonder.</l><ref type="line number">410</ref>
<l n="42.411">Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
<l n="42.412">By the red boat's side was lifting</l>
<l n="42.413">High his head from out the water,</l>
<l n="42.414">Raising it from out the billows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.415">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="42.416">Grasped his ears upon the instant,</l>
<l n="42.417">By his ears he dragged him upward,</l>
<l n="42.418">And he sang aloud, and questioned,</l>
<l n="42.419">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="42.420">"Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l><ref type="line number">420</ref>
<l n="42.421">Wherefore from the lake uplift thee,</l>
<l n="42.422">Wherefore rise above the lake-waves,</l>
<l n="42.423">Thus thyself to men revealing,</l>
<l n="42.424">Even Kaleva's own children?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.425">Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
<l n="42.426">Was not pleased with this reception,</l>
<l n="42.427">But he was not very frightened,</l>
<l n="42.428">And no answer he returned him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.429">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="42.430">Asked again an explanation,</l><ref type="line number">430</ref>
<l n="42.431">And a third time asked him loudly,</l>
<l n="42.432">"Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
<l n="42.433">Wherefore from the lake uplift thee,</l>
<l n="42.434">Wherefore rise above the billows?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.435">Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l>
<l n="42.436">When for the third time he asked him,</l>
<l n="42.437">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="42.438">"Therefore from the lake I raise me,</l>
<l n="42.439">Therefore rise above the billows,</l>
<l n="42.440">For that in my mind I purpose</l><ref type="line number">440</ref>
<l n="42.441">Kaleva's great race to ruin,</l>
<l n="42.442">Bear to Pohjola the Sampo.</l>
<l n="42.443">In the waves if you will send me,</l>
<l n="42.444">And my wretched life concede me,</l>
<l n="42.445">Not another time ascending,</l>
<l n="42.446">In the sight of men I'll venture.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.447">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="42.448">Cast the wretch into the billows,</l>
<l n="42.449">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="42.450">"Iku-Turso, son of Äijö,</l><ref type="line number">450</ref>
<l n="42.451">Nevermore from lake arising,</l>
<l n="42.452">Or ascending from the lake-waves,</l>
<l n="42.453">Venture forth where men can see thee,</l>
<l n="42.454">From this very day henceforward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.455">Therefore from that day thenceforward,</l>
<l n="42.456">Never from the lake rose Turso,</l>
<l n="42.457">In the sight of men to venture,</l>
<l n="42.458">Long as sun and moon are shining,</l>
<l n="42.459">Or the pleasant day is dawning,</l>
<l n="42.460">And the air is most delightful.</l><ref type="line number">460</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.461">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="42.462">Once again steered on the vessel.</l>
<l n="42.463">But a little time passed over,</l>
<l n="42.464">Short the time that then passed over,</l>
<l n="42.465">When did Ukko, God the Highest,</l>
<l n="42.466">Of the air the mighty ruler,</l>
<l n="42.467">Winds arouse in magic fury,</l>
<l n="42.468">Made the tempests rage around them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.469">Then the winds arose in fury,</l>
<l n="42.470">And the tempests raged around them,</l><ref type="line number">470</ref>
<l n="42.471">And the west wind blew most fiercely,</l>
<l n="42.472">From the south-west just as fiercely,</l>
<l n="42.473">And the south wind still more fiercely,</l>
<l n="42.474">And the east wind whistled loudly,</l>
<l n="42.475">Roared the south-east wind tremendous,</l>
<l n="42.476">And the north wind howled in fury.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.477">From the trees the leaves were scattered,</l>
<l n="42.478">And the pine-trees lost their needles,</l>
<l n="42.479">And the heather lost its flowerets,</l>
<l n="42.480">And the grasses lost their tassels,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="42.481">And the black ooze was uplifted</l>
<l n="42.482">To the sparkling water's surface.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.483">Still the winds were wildly blowing,</l>
<l n="42.484">And the waves assailed the vessel,</l>
<l n="42.485">Swept away the harp of pikebone,</l>
<l n="42.486">And the kantele of fish-fins,</l>
<l n="42.487">Joy for Vellamo's attendants,</l>
<l n="42.488">And to Ahtola a pleasure.</l>
<l n="42.489">Ahto on the waves perceived it,</l>
<l n="42.490">On the waves his children saw it,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="42.491">And they took the harp so charming,</l>
<l n="42.492">And unto their home conveyed it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.493">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="42.494">From his eyes wept tears of sadness,</l>
<l n="42.495">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="42.496">"Thus has gone what I constructed,</l>
<l n="42.497">And my cherished harp has vanished,</l>
<l n="42.498">And is lost my life-long pleasure.</l>
<l n="42.499">Never will it happen to me,</l>
<l n="42.500">In the course of all my lifetime</l><ref type="line number">500</ref>
<l n="42.501">To rejoice again in pike-teeth,</l>

<lg>
<l n="42.503">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="42.504">Felt the very greatest sadness,</l>
<l n="42.505">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="42.506">"Woe to me, this day unhappy,</l>
<l n="42.507">That upon the lake I travel,</l>
<l n="42.508">On this wide expanse of water,</l>
<l n="42.509">That I tread on wood that's rolling,</l>
<l n="42.510">And on planks that shake beneath me.</l><ref type="line number">510</ref>
<l n="42.511">Now my hair has seen the tempest,</l>
<l n="42.512">And my hair begins to shudder,</l>

<l n="42.514">Which it saw upon the water,</l>
<l n="42.515">Yet have we but seldom witnessed,</l>
<l n="42.516">Such a storm as rages round us,</l>
<l n="42.517">Witnessed such tremendous breakers,</l>
<l n="42.518">Or have seen such foam-capped billows.</l>
<l n="42.519">Let the wind be now my refuge,</l>
<l n="42.520">And the waves have mercy on me."</l><ref type="line number">520</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.521">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="42.522">Heard his words, and thus responded:</l>
<l n="42.523">"In the boat's no place for weeping,</l>
<l n="42.524">Room is none for lamentation,</l>
<l n="42.525">Weeping helps not in misfortune,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.527">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="42.528">And he sang and thus expressed him:</l>

<lg>
<l n="42.535">"Rise, O wind, aloft to heaven,</l>

<l n="42.541">Rather fell burnt trees in clearings,</l>
<l n="42.542">On the slopes o'erthrow the pine-trees.</l>

<lg>
<l n="42.543">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.551">He himself enlarged the bulwarks,</l>

<l n="42.556">Nor upon his beard they splashed him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="42.557">All his work was now completed,</l>
<l n="42.558">And the bulwarks raised protecting,</l>

<head>THE FIGHT FOR THE SAMPO</head>
<div type="argument">
The Mistress of Pohjola equips a war-vessel and goes in pursuit of the robbers of the Sampo (1-22). When she overtakes them a fight ensues between the forces of Pohjola and Kalevala in which the latter conquer (23-258). Nevertheless the Mistress of Pohjola succeeds in dragging the Sampo from the boat into the lake, where it breaks to pieces (259-266). The larger portions sink in the lake, and form its riches, while the smaller pieces are thrown on shore by the waves, at which Väinämöinen is much pleased (267-304). The Mistress of Pohjola threatens to send all evil upon Kalevala, to which Väinämöinen pays no attention (305-368). The Mistress of Pohjola returns home in great distress, taking with her only a small fragment of the cover of the Sampo (369-384). Väinämöinen carefully collects the fragments of the Sampo on the shore, and plants them, hoping for continuous good fortune (385-434).

<l n="43.006">As a war-ship she prepared it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.007">In the ship the men she stationed,</l>
<l n="43.008">And equipped for war the heroes,</l>
<l n="43.009">As the duck her ducklings musters,</l>
<l n="43.010">Or the teal her children marshals;</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="43.011">There she ranged a hundred swordsmen,</l>
<l n="43.012">And a thousand men with crossbows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.013">In the boat the mast she lifted,</l>
<l n="43.014">Put the yards and spars in order,</l>
<l n="43.015">On the mast the sails adjusted,</l>
<l n="43.016">Spread the canvas o'er the sailyards;</l>
<l n="43.017">Like a hanging cloud it waved there,</l>
<l n="43.018">Like a cloud in heaven suspended;</l>
<l n="43.019">Then upon her voyage she started,</l>
<l n="43.020">Sailed away and speeded onward,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="43.021">Soon to struggle for the Sampo,</l>
<l n="43.022">With the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.023">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="43.024">O'er the blue lake steered his vessel,</l>
<l n="43.025">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="43.026">From the stern where he was seated:</l>
<l n="43.027">"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
<l n="43.028">Of my friends the dearest to me,</l>
<l n="43.029">Climb thou quickly to the masthead,</l>
<l n="43.030">And among the canvas hasten.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="43.031">Look thou to the air before thee,</l>
<l n="43.032">Look thou to the sky behind thee,</l>
<l n="43.033">Whether clear is the horizon,</l>
<l n="43.034">Or the sky is somewhat clouded.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.035">Then the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="43.036">Ruddy youth, accomplished scoundrel,</l>
<l n="43.037">Very active, though unbidden,</l>
<l n="43.038">Very quick, though never boastful,</l>
<l n="43.039">To the masthead then ascended,</l>
<l n="43.040">Up aloft among the canvas.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="43.041">East he looked, and looked to westward,</l>
<l n="43.042">Looked to north-west and to southward,</l>
<l n="43.043">Looked across to Pohja's coast-line,</l>
<l n="43.044">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.045">"Clear in front is the horizon,</l>
<l n="43.046">Dark behind is the horizon,</l>
<l n="43.047">Rises north a cloud, a small one,</l>
<l n="43.048">Hangs a single cloud to north-west.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.049">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="43.050">"What you say is surely nonsense,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="43.051">For no cloud is there ascending,</l>
<l n="43.052">Nor a single cloud arising,</l>
<l n="43.053">But perchance a sailing vessel;</l>
<l n="43.054">Look again, and look more sharply.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.055">Then he looked again more sharply,</l>
<l n="43.056">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.057">"Far away I see an island,</l>
<l n="43.058">Dimly looming in the distance,</l>
<l n="43.059">Aspens covered o'er with falcons,</l>
<l n="43.060">Speckled grouse upon the birch-trees."</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.061">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="43.062">"What you say is surely nonsense,</l>
<l n="43.063">For no falcons do you see there,</l>
<l n="43.064">And no speckled grouse you see there,</l>
<l n="43.065">But perchance the sons of Pohja;</l>
<l n="43.066">Look more sharply for the third time.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.067">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="43.068">For the third time looked around him,</l>
<l n="43.069">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="43.070">And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="43.071">"'Tis a ship from Pohja sailing,</l>
<l n="43.072">With a hundred rowlocks fitted,</l>
<l n="43.073">And I see a hundred oarsmen,</l>
<l n="43.074">And a thousand men beside them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.075">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="43.076">All the truth at once perceiving,</l>
<l n="43.077">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.078">"Row, thou smith; row, Ilmarinen;</l>
<l n="43.079">Row, O lively Lemminkainen;</l>
<l n="43.080">Row ye also, all ye people,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="43.081">That the boat be hurried forward,</l>
<l n="43.082">And the vessel onward driven.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.083">Rowed the smith, rowed Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="43.084">Rowed the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="43.085">All the people joined in rowing.</l>
<l n="43.086">Swayed about the pinewood oars,</l>
<l n="43.087">Loudly rang the rowan rowlocks,</l>
<l n="43.088">And the pinewood boat was swaying.</l>
<l n="43.089">Like a seal the prow dashed onward,</l>
<l n="43.090">Boiled the waves behind like cataract,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="43.091">Like a bell uprose the water,</l>
<l n="43.092">And the foam flew up in masses.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.093">As for wager rowed the heroes,</l>
<l n="43.094">As in race the heroes struggled,</l>
<l n="43.095">But they rowed, and made no progress,</l>
<l n="43.096">Nor could urge the wooden vessel</l>
<l n="43.097">Further from the sailing vessel,</l>
<l n="43.098">And the ship that came from Pohja.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.099">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="43.100">Saw misfortune fast approaching.</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="43.101">On his head was doomsday falling,</l>
<l n="43.102">And he pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="43.103">How to act and how to save him,</l>
<l n="43.104">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.105">"Still I know a plan of safety,</l>
<l n="43.106">Still I see a little marvel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.107">Then he took a piece of tinder,</l>
<l n="43.108">In his tinder-box he found it,</l>
<l n="43.109">And of pitch he took a little,</l>
<l n="43.110">And a little piece of tinder,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="43.111">And into the lake he threw it,</l>
<l n="43.112">O'er his shoulder left he threw it,</l>
<l n="43.113">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="43.114">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="43.115">"Let a reef of this be fashioned,</l>
<l n="43.116">And a cliff be fashioned from it,</l>
<l n="43.117">Where may run the ship of Pohja,</l>
<l n="43.118">Fitted with a hundred rowlocks,</l>
<l n="43.119">And may strike in lake tempestuous,</l>
<l n="43.120">And amid the waves be shattered."</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.121">Thereupon a reef grew upward,</l>
<l n="43.122">In the lake a cliff was fashioned,</l>
<l n="43.123">Half its length to east directed,</l>
<l n="43.124">And its breadth to north directed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.125">Onward sped the ship of Pohja,</l>
<l n="43.126">Gliding swiftly through the lake-waves,</l>
<l n="43.127">And upon the reef came rushing,</l>
<l n="43.128">And upon the rocks wedged firmly.</l>
<l n="43.129">Broke across the wooden vessel,</l>
<l n="43.130">And to splinters it was broken;</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="43.131">In the lake the masts fell crashing,</l>
<l n="43.132">And the sails fell drooping downward,</l>
<l n="43.133">By the wind away were carried,</l>
<l n="43.134">And the spring wind all dispersed them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.135">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="43.136">Plunged her feet into the water,</l>
<l n="43.137">And she tried to push the vessel,</l>
<l n="43.138">And she tried to raise the vessel,</l>
<l n="43.139">But no spear could lift the vessel,</l>
<l n="43.140">And she could not even move it,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="43.141">For the ribs had all been shattered,</l>
<l n="43.142">All the rowlocks had been broken.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.143">And she pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="43.144">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.145">"Who can aid me now with counsel?</l>
<l n="43.146">Who can help me in this trouble?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.147">Then her form she quickly altered,</l>
<l n="43.148">To another shape transformed her,</l>
<l n="43.149">And she took five scythes the sharpest,</l>
<l n="43.150">And six hoes, worn out completely;</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="43.151">These she fashioned into talons,</l>
<l n="43.152">Into claws did she convert them;</l>
<l n="43.153">Half the broken vessel's fragments</l>
<l n="43.154">Did she then arrange beneath her,</l>
<l n="43.155">And the sides to wings she fashioned,</l>
<l n="43.156">And to tail she turned the rudder,</l>
<l n="43.157">'Neath her wings took men a hundred,</l>
<l n="43.158">On her tail she took a thousand,</l>
<l n="43.159">And the hundred men were swordsmen,</l>
<l n="43.160">And the thousand men were archers.</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="43.161">Then she flew, her wings extending,</l>
<l n="43.162">And she soared aloft as eagle,</l>
<l n="43.163">And she poised herself and hovered,</l>
<l n="43.164">To attack old Väinämöinen;</l>
<l n="43.165">In the clouds one wing was flapping,</l>
<l n="43.166">In the water splashed the other.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.167">Then the fairest Water-Mother</l>
<l n="43.168">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.169">"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="43.170">Turn thy head beneath the sunrise,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="43.171">Do thou turn thine eyes to north-west,</l>
<l n="43.172">Look a little now behind thee.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.173">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="43.174">Turned his head beneath the sunrise,</l>
<l n="43.175">And he turned his eyes to north-west,</l>
<l n="43.176">Looked a little just behind him.</l>
<l n="43.177">Onward came the crone of Pohja,</l>
<l n="43.178">And the wondrous bird was hovering</l>
<l n="43.179">Like a hawk about his shoulders,</l>
<l n="43.180">With the body of an eagle.</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.181">Soon she came near Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="43.182">And she flew upon the masthead,</l>
<l n="43.183">Clambered out upon the sailyard,</l>
<l n="43.184">And upon the pole she sat her,</l>
<l n="43.185">And the boat was nearly sinking,</l>
<l n="43.186">And the vessel's side lurched downward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.187">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="43.188">Sought from Jumala assistance,</l>
<l n="43.189">And invoking the Creator,</l>
<l n="43.190">Then he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="43.191">"Save us, O thou good Creator,</l>
<l n="43.192">Gracious Jumala, protect us,</l>
<l n="43.193">That the son may not be hurried,</l>
<l n="43.194">Nor the mother's child hurled downward,</l>
<l n="43.195">From among the living creatures,</l>
<l n="43.196">From the creatures whom thou rulest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.197">"Ukko, Jumala the Highest,</l>
<l n="43.198">Thou our Father in the heavens,</l>
<l n="43.199">Cast a fiery robe around me,</l>
<l n="43.200">Over me a shirt of fire,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="43.201">That I thus may fight protected,</l>
<l n="43.202">And may thus contend protected,</l>
<l n="43.203">That my head may fear no evil,</l>
<l n="43.204">Nor my hair may be disordered,</l>
<l n="43.205">When the shining swords are clashing,</l>
<l n="43.206">And the steely points are meeting.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.207">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="43.208">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.209">"Hail, O Pohjola's great Mistress!</l>
<l n="43.210">Wilt thou now divide the Sampo,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="43.211">Out upon the jutting headland,</l>
<l n="43.212">On the misty island's summit?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.213">Then said Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="43.214">"No, I'll not divide the Sampo,</l>
<l n="43.215">Not with thee, thou wretched creature,</l>
<l n="43.216">Not with thee, O Väinämöinen!"</l>
<l n="43.217">And she swooped to snatch the Sampo</l>
<l n="43.218">From the boat of Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.219">Then the lively Lemminkainen</l>
<l n="43.220">Drew his sword from out his swordbelt,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="43.221">Firm he grasped the sharpened iron,</l>
<l n="43.222">And from his left side he drew it,</l>
<l n="43.223">Striking at the eagle's talons,</l>
<l n="43.224">At the claws of eagle striking.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.225">Struck the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="43.226">As he struck, these words he uttered:</l>
<l n="43.227">"Down ye men, and down ye swordsmen,</l>
<l n="43.228">Down with all the sleepy heroes!</l>
<l n="43.229">From her wings, ye men a hundred,</l>
<l n="43.230">Ten from ends of every feather."</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.231">Answered then the crone of Pohja,</l>
<l n="43.232">And she answered from the masthead:</l>
<l n="43.233">"O thou lively son of Lempi,</l>
<l n="43.234">Wretched Kauko, worthless fellow,</l>
<l n="43.235">For thou hast deceived thy mother,</l>
<l n="43.236">Lied unto thy aged mother!</l>
<l n="43.237">Thou wast pledged to seek no battle</l>
<l n="43.238">In the space of sixty summers,</l>
<l n="43.239">Whether need of gold should tempt thee,</l>
<l n="43.240">Or the love of silver urge thee."</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>

<l n="43.241">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="43.242">He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
<l n="43.243">Thought his doom had come upon him,</l>
<l n="43.244">And he felt his bane approaching;</l>
<l n="43.245">From the lake he drew the rudder,</l>
<l n="43.246">Took the oak-spar from the billows,</l>
<l n="43.247">And with this he struck the monster,</l>
<l n="43.248">On the claws he struck the eagle,</l>
<l n="43.249">All the other claws he shattered,</l>
<l n="43.250">There remained the smallest only.</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.251">From her wings the youths dropped downward,</l>

<l n="43.253">From beneath her wings a hundred,</l>
<l n="43.254">From her tail a thousand heroes;</l>
<l n="43.255">Down there dropped the eagle likewise,</l>
<l n="43.256">Crashing down upon the boat-ribs,</l>
<l n="43.257">As from tree the capercailzie,</l>
<l n="43.258">Or from fir-branch drops the squirrel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.259">Then she tried to seize the Sampo,</l>
<l n="43.260">Seized it with her nameless finger,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="43.261">From the boat she dragged the Sampo,</l>
<l n="43.262">Down she pulled the pictured cover,</l>
<l n="43.263">From the red boat's hold she pulled it,</l>
<l n="43.264">'Mid the blue lake's waters cast it,</l>
<l n="43.265">And the Sampo broke to pieces,</l>
<l n="43.266">And was smashed the pictured cover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.267">Then the fragments all were scattered,</l>
<l n="43.268">And the Sampo's larger pieces</l>
<l n="43.269">Sank beneath the peaceful waters</l>
<l n="43.270">To the black ooze at the bottom;</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="43.271">Thence there springs the water's riches,</l>
<l n="43.272">And the wealth of Ahto's people.</l>

<l n="43.276">Neither shall his watery honours.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.277">Other pieces were remaining,</l>
<l n="43.278">Rather small those other fragments,</l>
<l n="43.279">On the blue lake's surface floating,</l>
<l n="43.280">Tossing on the broad lake's billows,</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="43.281">And the wind for ever rocked them,</l>
<l n="43.282">And the billows drove them onward.</l>

<lg>
<l n="43.283">And the wind still rocked the fragments,</l>
<l n="43.284">And the lake-waves ever tossed them,</l>
<l n="43.285">On the blue lake's surface floating,</l>
<l n="43.286">Tossing on the broad lake's billows;</l>
<l n="43.287">To the land the wind impelled them,</l>
<l n="43.288">To the shore the billows drove them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.289">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="43.290">In the surf beheld them floating,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="43.291">Through the breakers shoreward driving,</l>
<l n="43.292">Then on shore upcast by billows,</l>
<l n="43.293">Saw the fragments of the Sampo,</l>
<l n="43.294">Splinters of the pictured cover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="43.295">Very greatly did it please him,</l>
<l n="43.296">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="43.297">"From these seeds the plant is sprouting,</l>
<l n="43.298">Lasting welfare is commencing,</l>
<l n="43.299">Here is ploughing, here is sowing,</l>

<l n="43.305">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="43.306">Speak aloud the words which follow:</l>

<l n="43.349">"Go thou, Pohjola's great Mistress,</l>
<l n="43.350">Drag unto the stones the lost ones,</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>

<l n="43.369">Then did Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="43.370">Answer in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">370</ref>
<l n="43.371">"Now my might has all departed,</l>

<l n="43.377">Nothing worthy to be mentioned</l>

<l n="43.385">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="43.386">Went back likewise to his country,</l>

<l n="43.390">From the fine sand of the margin.</l><ref type="line number">390</ref>
</lg>

<l n="43.391">And he sowed the Sampo's fragments,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN'S NEW KANTELE</head>
<div type="argument">
Väinämöinen goes to seek for his kantele which was lost in the lake, but cannot find it (1-76). He makes himself a new kantele of birchwood, on which he plays, and delights every creature in the neighbourhood (77-334).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="44.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="44.002">In his mind was thus reflecting:</l>
<l n="44.003">"Now the time has come for music,</l>
<l n="44.004">Time to give ourselves to pleasure,</l>
<l n="44.005">In our dwelling newly chosen,</l>
<l n="44.006">In our homestead now so charming,</l>
<l n="44.007">But the kantele is sunken,</l>
<l n="44.008">And my joy has gone for ever</l>
<l n="44.009">To the dwelling-place of fishes,</l>
<l n="44.010">To the rock-caves of the salmon,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="44.011">Where it may enchant the lake-pike,</l>
<l n="44.012">Likewise Vellamo's attendants;</l>
<l n="44.013">But they never will return it,</l>
<l n="44.014">Ahto will no more return it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.015">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="44.016">Yestreen and before thou workedst,</l>
<l n="44.017">Work to-day with equal vigour.</l>
<l n="44.018">Forge me now a rake of iron,</l>
<l n="44.019">Let the teeth be close together,</l>
<l n="44.020">Close the teeth, and long the handle</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="44.021">That I rake among the billows,</l>
<l n="44.022">And may rake the waves together,</l>
<l n="44.023">And may rake among the lake-reeds,</l>
<l n="44.024">With the rake rake all the margins,</l>
<l n="44.025">And my instrument recover,</l>
<l n="44.026">And the kantele recover,</l>
<l n="44.027">From the devious paths of fishes,</l>
<l n="44.028">From the rocky caves of salmon.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.029">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="44.030">He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="44.031">Forged for him a rake of iron,</l>
<l n="44.032">Furnished with a copper handle,</l>
<l n="44.033">Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,</l>
<l n="44.034">And the handle full five hundred.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.035">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="44.036">Took the mighty rake of iron,</l>
<l n="44.037">And a little way he wandered,</l>
<l n="44.038">Made a very little journey,</l>
<l n="44.039">Till he reached the quay, steel-fitted,</l>
<l n="44.040">And the landing-stage of copper.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="44.041">There he found a boat, found two boats,</l>
<l n="44.042">Both the boats were waiting ready</l>
<l n="44.043">On the quay, with steel all fitted,</l>
<l n="44.044">On the landing-stage of copper,</l>
<l n="44.045">And the first boat was a new one,</l>
<l n="44.046">And the second was an old one.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.047">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="44.048">To the new boat firstly speaking:</l>
<l n="44.049">"Go, thou boat, into the water,</l>
<l n="44.050">To the waves, O vessel, rush thou,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="44.051">Even though no arm should turn thee,</l>
<l n="44.052">Even though no thumbs should touch thee.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.053">Sped the boat into the water,</l>
<l n="44.054">Rushed amid the waves the vessel.</l>
<l n="44.055">Old and steadfast Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="44.056">In the stern made haste to seat him,</l>
<l n="44.057">And he went to sweep the water,</l>
<l n="44.058">And to sweep among the billows.</l>
<l n="44.059">Scattered leaves of water-lilies,</l>
<l n="44.060">Raked he up among the shore-drift,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="44.061">All the rubbish raked together,</l>
<l n="44.062">All the rubbish, bits of rushes,</l>
<l n="44.063">Every scrap he raked together,</l>
<l n="44.064">All the shoals with care raked over,</l>
<l n="44.065">But he found not, nor discovered,</l>
<l n="44.066">Where his pike-bone harp was hidden,</l>
<l n="44.067">And this joy was gone for ever,</l>
<l n="44.068">With the kantele was sunken.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.069">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="44.070">Then returned unto his dwelling,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="44.071">Head bowed down, and sadly grieving,</l>
<l n="44.072">And his cap awry adjusted,</l>
<l n="44.073">And he said the words which follow:</l>
<l n="44.074">"Unto me is lost for ever</l>
<l n="44.075">Pleasure from the harp of pike-teeth,</l>
<l n="44.076">From the harp I made of fish-bone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.077">As he wandered through the country,</l>
<l n="44.078">On the borders of the woodlands,</l>
<l n="44.079">There he heard a birch-tree weeping,</l>
<l n="44.080">And a speckled tree lamenting,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="44.081">And in that direction hastened,</l>
<l n="44.082">Walking till he reached the birch-tree.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.083">Thereupon he spoke and asked it,</l>
<l n="44.084">"Wherefore weep'st thou, beauteous birch-tree,</l>
<l n="44.085">Shedding tears, O green-leaved birch-tree,</l>
<l n="44.086">By thy belt of white conspicuous?</l>
<l n="44.087">To the war thou art not taken,</l>
<l n="44.088">Longest not for battle-struggle.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.089">Answer made the leaning birch-tree,</l>
<l n="44.090">And the green-leaved tree responded:</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="44.091">"There is much that I could speak of,</l>
<l n="44.092">Many things I might reflect on,</l>
<l n="44.093">How I best might live in pleasure,</l>
<l n="44.094">And I might rejoice for pleasure.</l>
<l n="44.095">I am wretched in my sorrow,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.099">"And I weep my utter weakness,</l>

<lg>
<l n="44.159">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<l n="44.167">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="44.168">Carved into a harp the birch-tree,</l>
<l n="44.169">On a summer day he carved it,</l>
<l n="44.170">To a kantele he shaped it,</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="44.171">At the end of cloudy headland,</l>

<lg>
<l n="44.183">In the yard there grew an oak-tree,</l>
<l n="44.184">By the farmyard it was standing,</l>

<l n="44.186">And on every branch an acorn,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.189">When the cuckoos all were calling,</l>
<l n="44.190">In the call five tones were sounding,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="44.191">Gold from out their mouths was flowing,</l>
<l n="44.192">Silver too they scattered round them,</l>
<l n="44.193">On a hill the gold was flowing,</l>
<l n="44.194">On the ground there flowed the silver,</l>
<l n="44.195">And from this he made the harp-screws,</l>
<l n="44.196">And the pegs from that provided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.197">Said the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="44.198">In the very words which follow:</l>

<l n="44.201">Something even now is wanting,</l>

<l n="44.204">Which shall yield the notes in playing?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.205">Then he went to seek for harp-strings,</l>
<l n="44.206">And along the heath he wandered.</l>
<l n="44.207">On the heath there sat a maiden,</l>
<l n="44.208">Sat a damsel in the valley,</l>
<l n="44.209">And the maiden was not weeping,</l>
<l n="44.210">Neither was she very joyful.</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="44.211">To herself she sang full softly,</l>
<l n="44.212">Sang, that soon might come the evening,</l>
<l n="44.213">Hoping for her lover's coming,</l>
<l n="44.214">For the dear one she had chosen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.215">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="44.216">Crept without his shoes towards her,</l>
<l n="44.217">Sprang to her without his stockings,</l>
<l n="44.218">And as soon as he approached her,</l>
<l n="44.219">He besought her hair to give him,</l>
<l n="44.220">And he spoke the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="44.221">"Give thy hair to me, O maiden,</l>
<l n="44.222">Give me of thy hair, O fair one,</l>
<l n="44.223">Give me hair to form my harp-strings,</l>
<l n="44.224">For the tones of lasting pleasure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.225">Then her hair the maiden gave him,</l>
<l n="44.226">From her soft locks hair she gave him,</l>
<l n="44.227">And she gave him five and six hairs,</l>
<l n="44.228">Seven the hairs she gave unto him,</l>
<l n="44.229">That he thus might form his harp-strings,</l>
<l n="44.230">For the tones of lasting pleasure.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.231">Now the harp at last was finished,</l>
<l n="44.232">And the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="44.233">On a rock his seat selected,</l>
<l n="44.234">Near the steps, upon a stone bench.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.235">In his hands the harp then taking,</l>
<l n="44.236">Very near he felt his pleasure,</l>
<l n="44.237">And the frame he turned to heaven,</l>
<l n="44.238">On his knees the knob then propping,</l>
<l n="44.239">All the strings he put in order,</l>
<l n="44.240">Fit to make melodious music.</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="44.241">When he had the strings adjusted,</l>
<l n="44.242">Then the instrument was ready;</l>
<l n="44.243">Underneath his hands he placed it,</l>
<l n="44.244">And across his knees he laid it,</l>
<l n="44.245">With his ten nails did he play it,</l>
<l n="44.246">And he let five active fingers</l>
<l n="44.247">Draw the tunes from out the harp-strings,</l>
<l n="44.248">Making most delightful music.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.249">When the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="44.250">Thus upon his harp was playing,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="44.251">Fine his hands, his fingers tender,</l>
<l n="44.252">And his fingers curving outwards,</l>
<l n="44.253">Then rang out the wood so speckled,</l>
<l n="44.254">Sang the sapling green full loudly,</l>
<l n="44.255">Loudly called the golden cuckoo,</l>
<l n="44.256">And rejoiced the hair of maiden.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.257">Thus played Väinämöinen's fingers,</l>
<l n="44.258">And the harp-strings loud resounded,</l>
<l n="44.259">Mountains shook and plains resounded,</l>
<l n="44.260">All the rocky hills resounded,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="44.261">In the waves the stones were rocking,</l>
<l n="44.262">In the water moved the gravel,</l>
<l n="44.263">And the pine-trees were rejoicing,</l>
<l n="44.264">On the heath the stumps were skipping.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.265">All of Kaleva's step-daughters,</l>
<l n="44.266">All the fair ones flocked together,</l>
<l n="44.267">And in streams they rushed together,</l>
<l n="44.268">Like a river in its flowing.</l>
<l n="44.269">Merry laughed the younger women,</l>
<l n="44.270">And the mothers all were joyful,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="44.271">As they heard the music playing,</l>
<l n="44.272">And they wondered at their pleasure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.273">Likewise many men were present,</l>
<l n="44.274">In their hands their caps all holding,</l>
<l n="44.275">All the old dames in the party</l>
<l n="44.276">To their sides their hands were holding,</l>
<l n="44.277">And the maidens' eyes shed tear-drops,</l>
<l n="44.278">On the ground the boys were kneeling,</l>
<l n="44.279">To the kantele all listening,</l>
<l n="44.280">And they wondered at their pleasure.</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="44.281">With one voice they all were singing,</l>
<l n="44.282">With one tongue they all repeated:</l>
<l n="44.283">"Never have we heard aforetime,</l>
<l n="44.284">Heard before such charming music,</l>
<l n="44.285">In the course of all our lifetime,</l>
<l n="44.286">When the brilliant moon was shining.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.287">Far was heard the charming music,</l>
<l n="44.288">In six villages they heard it,</l>
<l n="44.289">There was not a single creature</l>
<l n="44.290">But it hurried forth to listen,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="44.291">And to hear the charming music</l>
<l n="44.292">From the kantele resounding.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.293">All the wild beasts of the forest</l>
<l n="44.294">Upright on their claws were resting</l>
<l n="44.295">To the kantele to listen,</l>
<l n="44.296">And they wondered at their pleasure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.297">All the birds in air then flying,</l>
<l n="44.298">Perched upon the neighbouring branches,</l>
<l n="44.299">All the fish that swam the waters,</l>
<l n="44.300">To the margin hastened quickly,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="44.301">And the worms in earth then creeping,</l>
<l n="44.302">Up above the ground then hastened,</l>
<l n="44.303">And they turned themselves and listened,</l>
<l n="44.304">Listened to the charming music,</l>
<l n="44.305">In the kantele rejoicing,</l>
<l n="44.306">And in Väinämöinen's singing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.307">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="44.308">Played in his most charming manner,</l>
<l n="44.309">Most melodiously resounding;</l>
<l n="44.310">And he played one day, a second,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="44.311">Playing on, without cessation,</l>
<l n="44.312">Every morning after breakfast,</l>
<l n="44.313">Girded with the selfsame girdle,</l>
<l n="44.314">And the same shirt always wearing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.315">When he in his house was playing,</l>
<l n="44.316">In his house of fir constructed,</l>
<l n="44.317">All the roofs resounded loudly,</l>
<l n="44.318">And the boards resounded likewise,</l>

<l n="44.321">And the hearthstones all were moving,</l>
<l n="44.322">Birchwood columns sang in answer.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.323">When he walked among the pinewoods,</l>
<l n="44.324">And he wandered through the firwoods,</l>
<l n="44.325">All the pines bowed down before him,</l>
<l n="44.326">To the very ground the fir-trees;</l>
<l n="44.327">On the grass the cones rolled round him,</l>
<l n="44.328">On the roots the needles scattered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="44.329">When he hurried through the greenwood,</l>
<l n="44.330">Or across the heath was hastening,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="44.331">All the leaves called gaily to him,</l>

<head>THE PESTILENCE IN KALEVALA</head>
<div type="argument">
The Mistress of Pohjola sends terrible diseases to Kalevala (1-190). Väinämöinen heals the people by powerful incantations and unguents (191-362).
</div>
<lg>
<l n="45.001">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="45.002">In her ears received the tidings</l>
<l n="45.003">That in Väinölä it prospered,</l>
<l n="45.004">And that Kalevala had flourished,</l>
<l n="45.005">Through the fragments of the Sampo,</l>
<l n="45.006">Fragments of the pictured cover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.007">Thereupon she grew most envious,</l>
<l n="45.008">And for evermore reflected</l>
<l n="45.009">On the death that she might fashion,</l>
<l n="45.010">How she best might bring destruction</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="45.011">On the people in Väinölä,</l>
<l n="45.012">And on Kalevala's whole people.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.013">Then she prayed aloud to Ukko,</l>
<l n="45.014">And she thus implored the Thunderer:</l>
<l n="45.015">"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="45.016">Slay thou Kaleva's whole people,</l>
<l n="45.017">Slay them with thy hail of iron,</l>
<l n="45.018">With thy steely needles slay them,</l>
<l n="45.019">Or by sickness let them perish,</l>
<l n="45.020">Let the evil nation perish,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="45.021">Let the men die in the farmyard,</l>
<l n="45.022">On the cowshed floor the women.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.023">Lived in Tuonela a blind maid,</l>
<l n="45.024">Loviatar, an aged woman,</l>
<l n="45.025">She the worst of Tuoni's daughters,</l>
<l n="45.026">And of Mana's maids most hideous,</l>
<l n="45.027">She, the source of every evil,</l>
<l n="45.028">Origin of woes a thousand,</l>
<l n="45.029">With a face of perfect blackness,</l>
<l n="45.030">And a skin of hue most hideous.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.031">Then this daughter black of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="45.032">Ulappala's blind-eyed damsel,</l>
<l n="45.033">Made her bed upon the pathway,</l>
<l n="45.034">On the straw in evil country,</l>
<l n="45.035">And her back she turned to windward,</l>
<l n="45.036">Sideways to the bitter weather,</l>
<l n="45.037">Backwards to the blast so freezing,</l>
<l n="45.038">And the chilling winds of morning.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.039">Then a great wind rose in fury,</l>
<l n="45.040">From the east a mighty tempest,</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
<l n="45.041">Blew this wretched creature pregnant,</l>
<l n="45.042">And she quickened from the tempest,</l>
<l n="45.043">On a barren waste all treeless,</l>
<l n="45.044">On the bare and grassless meadows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.045">And she bore a heavy burden,</l>
<l n="45.046">Bore a heavy painful burden,</l>
<l n="45.047">Bore it two months, bore it three months,</l>
<l n="45.048">And for four and five months bore it,</l>
<l n="45.049">Bore it seven months, bore it eight months,</l>
<l n="45.050">For the ninth month also bore it,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="45.051">As old wives are wont to reckon,</l>
<l n="45.052">And for half the tenth month likewise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.053">When the ninth month had passed over,</l>
<l n="45.054">And the tenth month was beginning,</l>
<l n="45.055">Then she writhed about in anguish,</l>
<l n="45.056">And the greatest pain oppressed her,</l>
<l n="45.057">But as yet she brought forth nothing,</l>
<l n="45.058">And no brood as yet resulted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.059">From her lair at length she moved her,</l>
<l n="45.060">In another place she laid her,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="45.061">And the wench in childbed laid her,</l>
<l n="45.062">Sport of winds, in hopes of children.</l>
<l n="45.063">There betwixt two rocks she laid her,</l>
<l n="45.064">In the clefts among five mountains,</l>
<l n="45.065">But as yet she brought forth nothing,</l>
<l n="45.066">And no brood as yet resulted.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.067">And she sought a place for breeding,</l>
<l n="45.068">Sought a place for bearing suited,</l>
<l n="45.069">In the quaking swamps she sought it,</l>
<l n="45.070">And among the waves she sought it,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="45.071">But she found no place to suit her,</l>
<l n="45.072">Where she could relieve her burden.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.073">Then she fain would bring forth children,</l>
<l n="45.074">And relieve her body's burden</l>
<l n="45.075">In the foam of furious cataract,</l>
<l n="45.076">'Neath where whirl the furious waters,</l>
<l n="45.077">Where three waterfalls are falling,</l>
<l n="45.078">Under nine of precipices,</l>
<l n="45.079">But as yet she brought forth nothing,</l>
<l n="45.080">Nor the foul one eased her burden.</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="45.081">Then began to weep, the foul one,</l>
<l n="45.082">And to howl, the wicked monster.</l>
<l n="45.083">Whither now to go she knew not,</l>
<l n="45.084">And in what direction wander,</l>
<l n="45.085">Where she might relieve her burden,</l>
<l n="45.086">Where to go to cast her offspring.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.087">From the clouds then bespoke her Jumala,</l>
<l n="45.088">The Creator spoke from heaven:</l>
<l n="45.089">"Stands in swamp a hut three-cornered,</l>
<l n="45.090">Just upon a lakelet's margin,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="45.091">In the gloomy land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="45.092">Near where Sariola's bay stretches.</l>
<l n="45.093">There thou may'st bring forth thy offspring,</l>
<l n="45.094">There lay down thy heavy burden,</l>
<l n="45.095">There it is that people need thee,</l>
<l n="45.096">There do they expect thy offspring.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.097">Therefore Tuoni's blackest daughter,</l>
<l n="45.098">Manala's most hideous damsel,</l>
<l n="45.099">Came unto the house of Pohja,</l>
<l n="45.100">Came to Sariola's great bathroom,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="45.101">That she there might bear her children,</l>
<l n="45.102">And she might bring forth her offspring.</l>

<lg>
<l n="45.103">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="45.104">Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
<l n="45.105">Secret led her to the bathroom,</l>

<l n="45.107">But the village did not know it,</l>
<l n="45.108">Nought was spoken in the village.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.109">Secretly she warmed the bathroom,</l>
<l n="45.110">Hastily she made it ready,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="45.111">And with ale the doors smeared over,</l>

<l n="45.114">And the hinges make no creaking.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.115">Then she spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="45.116">And expressed herself in thiswise:</l>

<l n="45.124">And the slime from creeping creatures,</l>
<l n="45.125">Do thou smear with this the gateway,</l>
<l n="45.126">And upon the sides anoint it,</l>
<l n="45.127">Free the damsel from her burden,</l>
<l n="45.128">And the woman from her sufferings,</l>
<l n="45.129">Free her from this grievous torment,</l>
<l n="45.130">And release her from her sufferings.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.131">"But if this is not sufficient,</l>
<l n="45.132">Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="45.133">Hither come where thou art needed,</l>
<l n="45.134">Come thou at our supplication.</l>
<l n="45.135">Here there is a girl in childbed,</l>
<l n="45.136">And a woman suffering greatly,</l>
<l n="45.137">Here amid the bathroom's vapour,</l>
<l n="45.138">Brought into the village bathroom.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="45.139">"Do thou take thy club all golden,</l>

<l n="45.141">Each impediment remove thou,</l>

<lg>
<l n="45.147">Then this foul and wicked creature,</l>
<l n="45.148">She, the daughter blind of Tuoni,</l>

<l n="45.171">One remained, and he was nameless,</l>

<head>VÄINÄMÖINEN AND THE BEAR</head>
<div type="argument">
The Mistress of Pohjola sends a bear to destroy the herds of Kalevala (1-20). Väinämöinen kills the bear, and a great feast is held in Kalevala in honour of the occasion (21-606). Väinämöinen sings, plays on the kantele, and hopes that a time of great happiness and prosperity is coming to Kalevala (607-644).

<l n="46.471">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="46.472">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="46.473">"Very gracious was the forest,</l>
<l n="46.474">Gracious wood, and forest lavish,</l>
<l n="46.475">And the greenwood's lord was joyous,</l>

<l n="46.477">"Mielikki, the forest's Mistress,</l>

<l n="46.480">Little damsel of the forest,</l><ref type="line number">480</ref>
<l n="46.481">Went along the path to guide me,</l>
<l n="46.482">And to raise the landmarks for me,</l>
<l n="46.483">By the roadside posts erected,</l>
<l n="46.484">And directed all my journey,</l>
<l n="46.485">And the trees she blazed before me,</l>
<l n="46.486">Marks she set upon the mountains,</l>
<l n="46.487">To the door of noble Otso,</l>
<l n="46.488">To the borders of his dwelling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.489">"When I reached the place I sought for,</l>
<l n="46.490">And arrived upon its borders,</l><ref type="line number">490</ref>
<l n="46.491">With the spear I smote not Otso,</l>
<l n="46.492">And I shot no arrows at him.</l>
<l n="46.493">He himself lurched from the archway,</l>
<l n="46.494">Tumbled from the pine-tree's summit,</l>
<l n="46.495">And the branches broke his breastbone,</l>
<l n="46.496">Others ripped his belly open.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.497">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.539">As no other man came forward,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.545">From the bear the teeth then taking,</l>
<l n="46.546">Uttered he the words which follow:</l>
<l n="46.547">"Otso, apple of the forest,</l>
<l n="46.548">Fair and bulky forest-dweller,</l>

<l n="46.551">Forth from out this narrow dwelling,</l>

<l n="46.560">To the needle-covered pine-trees,</l><ref type="line number">560</ref>
<l n="46.561">To the hills all clothed with forest,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.567">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="46.568">After this his dwelling entered,</l>
<l n="46.569">And the younger people asked him,</l>
<l n="46.570">All the handsome people asked him,</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
<l n="46.571">"Where have you bestowed your booty,</l>
<l n="46.572">Whither did you make your journey?</l>
<l n="46.573">Have you left him in the icefield,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.577">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="46.578">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="46.579">"In the ice I did not leave him,</l>
<l n="46.580">Sunk him not among the snow-slush,</l><ref type="line number">580</ref>
<l n="46.581">For the dogs from thence would drag him,</l>
<l n="46.582">Likewise would the birds befoul him.</l>
<l n="46.583">In the swamp I have not sunk him,</l>
<l n="46.584">Nor upon the heath have buried,</l>
<l n="46.585">For the worms would there destroy him</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.587">"Thither have I brought my booty,</l>
<l n="46.588">There bestowed my little captive,</l>

<l n="46.591">In a splendid tree I laid him,</l>
<l n="46.592">Pine-tree with a hundred needles,</l>
<l n="46.593">In the very largest branches,</l>
<l n="46.594">In the broad and leafy summit,</l>
<l n="46.595">As a joy to men for ever,</l>
<l n="46.596">And a pleasure to the travellers.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.597">"Then I turned his gums to eastward,</l>
<l n="46.598">And his eyes I turned to north-west,</l>
<l n="46.599">Not too high upon the summit,</l>
<l n="46.600">Lest if they were in the summit,</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
<l n="46.601">Then the wind might perhaps destroy them,</l>
<l n="46.602">And the spring wind treat them badly.</l>
<l n="46.603">Nor too near the ground I placed them,</l>
<l n="46.604">Lest if I too low had laid them,</l>

<l n="46.606">And the snouted ones o'erturn them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.607">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="46.608">Once again prepared for singing,</l>
<l n="46.609">For a splendid evening's pleasure,</l>
<l n="46.610">And a charm to day departing.</l><ref type="line number">610</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.611">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<l n="46.613">"Keep thy light, O holder, shining,</l>
<l n="46.614">So that I can see while singing,</l>
<l n="46.615">For the time has come for singing,</l>
<l n="46.616">And my mouth to sing is longing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.617">Played and sang old Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="46.618">Charming all throughout the evening,</l>
<l n="46.619">And when he had ceased his singing,</l>
<l n="46.620">Then a speech he made concluding:</l><ref type="line number">620</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="46.621">"Grant, O Jumala, in future,</l>
<l n="46.622">Once again, O good Creator,</l>

<head>THE ROBBERY OF THE SUN AND MOON</head>
<div type="argument">
The moon and sun descend to listen to Väinämöinen's playing. The Mistress of Pohjola succeeds in capturing them, hides them in a mountain, and steals the fire from the homes of Kalevala (1-40). Ukko, the Supreme God, is surprised at the darkness in the sky, and kindles fire for a new moon and a new sun (41-82). The fire falls to the ground, and Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen go to search for it (83-126). The Virgin of the Air informs them that the fire has fallen into Lake Alue, and has been swallowed by a fish (127-312). Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen try to catch the fish with a net of bast, but without success (313-364).

<lg>
<l n="47.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="47.002">On his kantele was playing,</l>
<l n="47.003">Long he played, and long was singing,</l>
<l n="47.004">And was ever full of gladness.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.005">In the moon's house heard they playing</l>
<l n="47.006">Came delight to the sun's window,</l>
<l n="47.007">And the moon came from his dwelling,</l>
<l n="47.008">Standing on a crooked birch-tree,</l>
<l n="47.009">And the sun came from his castle,</l>
<l n="47.010">Sitting on a fir-tree's summit,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="47.011">To the kantele to listen,</l>
<l n="47.012">Filled with wonder and rejoicing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.013">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="47.014">Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
<l n="47.015">Set to work the sun to capture,</l>
<l n="47.016">In her hands the moon seized likewise.</l>
<l n="47.017">From the birch the moon she captured,</l>
<l n="47.018">And the sun from fir-tree's summit;</l>
<l n="47.019">Straightway to her home she brought them,</l>
<l n="47.020">To the gloomy land of Pohja.</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.021">Then she hid the moon from shining,</l>
<l n="47.022">In the mottled rocks she hid him,</l>
<l n="47.023">Sang the sun to shine no longer,</l>
<l n="47.024">Hidden in a steel-hard mountain;</l>
<l n="47.025">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="47.026">"Never more again in freedom</l>
<l n="47.027">Shall the moon arise for shining,</l>
<l n="47.028">Nor the sun be free for shining,</l>
<l n="47.029">If I come not to release them,</l>
<l n="47.030">If I do not go to fetch them,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="47.031">When I bring nine stallions with me,</l>
<l n="47.032">Which a single mare has littered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.033">When the moon away was carried,</l>
<l n="47.034">And the sun had been imprisoned</l>
<l n="47.035">Deep in Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
<l n="47.036">In the rocks as hard as iron,</l>
<l n="47.037">Then she stole away the brightness,</l>
<l n="47.038">And from Väinölä the fires,</l>
<l n="47.039">And she left the houses fireless,</l>
<l n="47.040">And the rooms no flame illumined.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.041">Therefore was the night unending,</l>
<l n="47.042">And for long was utter darkness,</l>
<l n="47.043">Night in Kalevala for ever,</l>
<l n="47.044">And in Väinölä's fair dwellings,</l>
<l n="47.045">Likewise in the heavens was darkness,</l>
<l n="47.046">Darkness round the seat of Ukko.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.047">Life without the fire was weary,</l>
<l n="47.048">And without the light a burden,</l>
<l n="47.049">Unto all mankind 'twas dismal,</l>
<l n="47.050">And to Ukko's self 'twas dismal.</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.051">Ukko, then, of Gods the highest,</l>
<l n="47.052">In the air the great Creator,</l>
<l n="47.053">Now began to feel most strangely,</l>
<l n="47.054">And he pondered and reflected,</l>
<l n="47.055">What strange thing the moon had darkened,</l>
<l n="47.056">How the sun had been obstructed,</l>
<l n="47.057">That the moon would shine no longer,</l>
<l n="47.058">And the sun had ceased his shining.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.059">Then he stepped to cloudland's borders,</l>
<l n="47.060">On the borders of the heavens,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="47.061">Wearing now his pale blue stockings,</l>
<l n="47.062">With the heels of varied colour,</l>
<l n="47.063">And he went the moon to seek for,</l>
<l n="47.064">And he went to find the sunlight,</l>
<l n="47.065">Yet he could not find the moonlight,</l>
<l n="47.066">Nor the sun he could discover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.067">In the air a light struck Ukko,</l>
<l n="47.068">And a flame did Ukko kindle,</l>
<l n="47.069">From his flaming sword he struck it,</l>
<l n="47.070">Sparks he struck from off the sword-blade,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="47.071">From his nails he struck the fire,</l>
<l n="47.072">From his limbs he made it crackle,</l>
<l n="47.073">High above aloft in heaven,</l>
<l n="47.074">On the starry plains of heaven.</l>
<l n="47.075">When the fire had thus been kindled,</l>
<l n="47.076">Then he took the spark of fire,</l>
<l n="47.077">In his golden purse he thrust it,</l>
<l n="47.078">Placed it in his silver casket,</l>
<l n="47.079">And he bade the maiden rock it,</l>
<l n="47.080">Told the maid of air to rock it,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="47.081">That a new moon might be fashioned,</l>
<l n="47.082">And a new sun be constructed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.083">On the long cloud's edge she sat her,</l>
<l n="47.084">On the air-marge sat the maiden,</l>
<l n="47.085">There it was she rocked the fire,</l>
<l n="47.086">There she rocked the glowing brightness,</l>
<l n="47.087">In a golden cradle rocked it,</l>
<l n="47.088">With a silver cord she rocked it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.089">Then the silver props were shaken,</l>
<l n="47.090">Rocked about the golden cradle,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="47.091">Moved the clouds and creaked the heavens,</l>
<l n="47.092">And the props of heaven were swaying,</l>
<l n="47.093">With the rocking of the fire,</l>
<l n="47.094">And the rocking of the brightness.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.095">Thus the maid the fire was rocking,</l>
<l n="47.096">And she rocked the fire to brightness,</l>
<l n="47.097">With her fingers moved the fire,</l>
<l n="47.098">With her hands the fire she tended,</l>
<l n="47.099">And the stupid maiden dropped it,</l>

<l n="47.101">From her hands the fire dropped downward</l>

<l n="47.103">Then the sky was cleft asunder,</l>
<l n="47.104">All the air was filled with windows,</l>
<l n="47.105">Burst asunder by the fire-sparks,</l>
<l n="47.106">As the red drop quick descended,</l>
<l n="47.107">And a gap gleamed forth in heaven,</l>
<l n="47.108">As it through the clouds dropped downward,</l>
<l n="47.109">Through nine heavens the drop descended,</l>
<l n="47.110">Through six spangled vaults of heaven.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>

<l n="47.111">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.121">Thereupon set forth the heroes,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.127">And a river flowed before them,</l>
<l n="47.128">And became a lake extensive,</l>
<l n="47.129">And the aged Väinämöinen</l>

<lg>
<l n="47.135">Thus the boat at length was ready,</l>

<l n="47.141">Ilmatar, the lovely damsel,</l>

<l n="47.146">By what names do people call you?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.147">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>

<lg>
<l n="47.171">Then the woman gave them answer,</l>

<l n="47.175">It has evil wrought already,</l>

<lg>
<l n="47.187">"When the fire at length came thither,</l>
<l n="47.188">In the new-built house of Tuuri,</l>
<l n="47.189">Evil deeds he then accomplished,</l>
<l n="47.190">Shocking deeds he then accomplished,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>

<l n="47.201">And the child went off to Mana,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="47.215">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="47.216">Heard her words, and then made answer:</l>

<lg>
<l n="47.221">Then the matron made him answer,</l>

<l n="47.224">And the flame went wandering onward,</l>
<l n="47.225">First it burned o'er many districts,</l>

<lg>
<l n="47.231">"Three times in the nights of summer,</l>

<l n="47.248">Seized upon it the blue powan.</l>
<l n="47.249">Down he gulped the streak of fire,</l>

<lg>
<l n="47.335">In the water went the brothers,</l>

<head>THE CAPTURE OF THE FIRE</head>
<div type="argument">
The heroes prepare a linen net, and at length capture the fish which has swallowed the fire (1-192). The fire is found in the fish's belly, but flashes up suddenly, and burns Ilmarinen's cheeks and hands severely (193-248). The fire rushes into the forest, burns over many countries, and spreads further and further, till at length it is captured and carried to the dark dwellings of Kalevala (249-290). Ilmarinen recovers from his burns (291-372).

<lg>
<l n="48.001">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="48.002">He the great primeval minstrel,</l>
<l n="48.003">Thereupon began to ponder,</l>
<l n="48.004">And reflected on the method</l>
<l n="48.005">How to make a net of linen,</l>
<l n="48.006">How to make the hundred meshes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.007">Then he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="48.008">And expressed himself in thiswise:</l>
<l n="48.009">"Is there one who flax can sow me,</l>
<l n="48.010">Who can sow the flax and card it,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="48.011">And of this a net can make me,</l>
<l n="48.012">Weave for me its hundred meshes,</l>
<l n="48.013">Thus this wretched fish to slaughter,</l>
<l n="48.014">And destroy the fish unhappy?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.015">So a little spot they found him,</l>
<l n="48.016">Found a place not yet burned over,</l>
<l n="48.017">In the wide extent of marshes,</l>
<l n="48.018">There between two stumps they found it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.019">Thereupon they dug the roots out,</l>
<l n="48.020">And 'twas there they found the flaxseed,</l><ref type="line number">20</ref>
<l n="48.021">Guarded by the worm of Tuoni,</l>
<l n="48.022">There protected by the earthworm.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.023">There they found a heap of ashes;</l>
<l n="48.024">Dry the ashes that they found there,</l>
<l n="48.025">Of a wooden burned-up vessel,</l>
<l n="48.026">Of a boat that once had burned there.</l>
<l n="48.027">There it was they sowed the flaxseed,</l>
<l n="48.028">In the loose ash did they sow it,</l>
<l n="48.029">On the shore of Lake of Alue,</l>
<l n="48.030">There they sowed it in the clayfield.</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.031">Presently the shoot rose upward,</l>
<l n="48.032">And the flax grew thick and strongly,</l>
<l n="48.033">Grew beyond their expectations,</l>
<l n="48.034">In a single night of summer.</l>
<l n="48.035">Then they steeped it in the night-time,</l>
<l n="48.036">And they carded it by moonlight,</l>
<l n="48.037">And they cleansed it and they stripped it,</l>
<l n="48.038">And they beat it and they rubbed it,</l>
<l n="48.039">With their tools of steel they scraped it,</l>
<l n="48.040">And with all their strength they stripped it. 40</l>
<l n="48.041">Then they took the flax to steeping,</l>
<l n="48.042">And it soon began to soften,</l>
<l n="48.043">And they hastened then to pound it,</l>
<l n="48.044">Afterwards in haste they dried it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.045">Then into the house they brought it,</l>
<l n="48.046">And they hastened then to strip it,</l>
<l n="48.047">And they hastened next to beat it,</l>
<l n="48.048">And they hastened then to break it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.049">Then with diligence they cleansed it,</l>
<l n="48.050">In the twilight did they comb it,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="48.051">And upon the loom arranged it,</l>
<l n="48.052">Quicker brought it to the spindle,</l>
<l n="48.053">In a single night of summer;</l>
<l n="48.054">Thus between two days they worked it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.055">After this the sisters spun it,</l>
<l n="48.056">And their brothers' wives were netting,</l>
<l n="48.057">And the brothers worked the meshes,</l>
<l n="48.058">And the fathers also aided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.059">Quickly did they turn the netter,</l>
<l n="48.060">And the mesh with speed they twisted,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="48.061">Till the net was quite completed,</l>
<l n="48.062">And the cords were fixed upon it,</l>
<l n="48.063">In a single night of summer,</l>
<l n="48.064">Half another in addition.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.065">Thus the net was quite completed,</l>
<l n="48.066">And the cords were fixed upon it.</l>
<l n="48.067">And its length was hundred fathoms,</l>
<l n="48.068">And its breadth was hundreds seven;</l>
<l n="48.069">Stones for weights were fastened to it,</l>
<l n="48.070">Likewise proper floats provided.</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.071">With the net the youths were walking,</l>
<l n="48.072">And at home the old men pondered,</l>
<l n="48.073">Whether they would make a capture,</l>
<l n="48.074">And secure the fish they wished for.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.075">Then they drew the net and dragged it,</l>
<l n="48.076">Much they toiled, and threshed the water,</l>
<l n="48.077">Drew it lengthwise through the water,</l>
<l n="48.078">Dragged it crosswise through the water,</l>
<l n="48.079">Captured many little fishes,</l>
<l n="48.080">Many luckless perch they captured,</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
<l n="48.081">Many bony perch they captured,</l>
<l n="48.082">And a large-galled Redeye likewise,</l>
<l n="48.083">But the fish they could not capture</l>
<l n="48.084">That for which the net was fashioned.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.085">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="48.086">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="48.087">Let us now go forth together</l>
<l n="48.088">Where the net is in the water.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.089">Thereupon went both the heroes,</l>
<l n="48.090">And they drew it through the water,</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="48.091">And upon one side they spread it</l>
<l n="48.092">Round the islands in the water,</l>
<l n="48.093">And the other side directed,</l>
<l n="48.094">Round about the promontories,</l>
<l n="48.095">And the balance-pole was guided</l>
<l n="48.096">Just as aged Väinö pushed it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.097">Thus they cast the net and pushed it,</l>
<l n="48.098">And they drew the net and dragged it,</l>
<l n="48.099">Captured fishes in abundance,</l>
<l n="48.100">And they captured perch in plenty,</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="48.101">Salmon-trout in great abundance,</l>
<l n="48.102">Bream and salmon too they captured,</l>
<l n="48.103">All the fishes of the water,</l>
<l n="48.104">Only not the fish they sought for,</l>
<l n="48.105">That for which the net was woven,</l>
<l n="48.106">And the ropes were fastened to it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.107">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="48.108">Worked to make the net yet longer,</l>
<l n="48.109">Wider yet the sides expanded,</l>
<l n="48.110">Perhaps five hundred fathoms broader,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="48.111">Netted full seven hundred fathoms,</l>
<l n="48.112">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="48.113">"To the depths the nets we'll carry,</l>
<l n="48.114">And will now extend them further,</l>
<l n="48.115">Once again will drag the water,</l>
<l n="48.116">Thus another cast attempting.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.117">To the depths the nets they carried,</l>
<l n="48.118">Further did they then convey them,</l>
<l n="48.119">And again they dragged the water,</l>
<l n="48.120">Thus another cast attempting.</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.121">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="48.122">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="48.123">"Vellamo, O Water-Mother,</l>
<l n="48.124">Old one with the lavish bosom,</l>
<l n="48.125">Do thou change the shift upon thee,</l>
<l n="48.126">Do thou change thy dress completely,</l>
<l n="48.127">For thou hast a shift of rushes,</l>
<l n="48.128">On thy head a cap of lake-foam,</l>
<l n="48.129">Fashioned by the Wind's fair daughter,</l>
<l n="48.130">Which the billows' daughter gave thee.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="48.131">Now assume a shift of linen,</l>
<l n="48.132">Of the finest flax that's woven,</l>
<l n="48.133">Which by Kuutar has been woven,</l>
<l n="48.134">Päivätär has wrought when spinning.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.135">"Ahto, master of the billows,</l>
<l n="48.136">Ruler thou of caves a hundred,</l>
<l n="48.137">Take thy pole in length five fathoms,</l>
<l n="48.138">Take thy stake, in length full seven,</l>
<l n="48.139">Thresh with this the open water,</l>
<l n="48.140">And do thou stir up the lake-bed,</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="48.141">Stir thou all the heaps of refuse,</l>
<l n="48.142">Drive thou on the shoals of fishes,</l>
<l n="48.143">Where the net is spread to catch them,</l>
<l n="48.144">And its hundred floats are swimming,</l>
<l n="48.145">From the bays by fish frequented,</l>
<l n="48.146">From the caves where hide the salmon,</l>
<l n="48.147">From the wide lake's seething whirlpool,</l>
<l n="48.148">And from the profound abysses,</l>
<l n="48.149">Where the sun was never shining,</l>
<l n="48.150">Undisturbed the sand for ever."</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.151">From the lake a dwarf ascended,</l>
<l n="48.152">From the waves arose a hero,</l>
<l n="48.153">Stood upon the lake's broad surface,</l>
<l n="48.154">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="48.155">"Is there need to thresh the water,</l>
<l n="48.156">With a long pole to disturb it?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.157">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="48.158">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="48.159">"There is need to thresh the water,</l>
<l n="48.160">With a long pole to disturb it."</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="48.161">Then the dwarf, the little hero,</l>
<l n="48.162">Lifted from the bank a pine-tree,</l>
<l n="48.163">Took a tall tree from the pinewood,</l>
<l n="48.164">And prepared to thresh the water,</l>
<l n="48.165">And he asked, and spoke as follows:</l>
<l n="48.166">"Shall I thresh with strength sufficient,</l>
<l n="48.167">Putting forth my utmost efforts,</l>
<l n="48.168">Or as hard as may be needful?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.169">Old and prudent Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="48.170">Answered in the words which follow:</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="48.171">"If you thresh as hard as needful,</l>
<l n="48.172">You will have to do much threshing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.173">Then the man, the little hero,</l>
<l n="48.174">Set to work to thresh the water,</l>
<l n="48.175">And he threshed as much as needful,</l>
<l n="48.176">And he drove the shoals of fishes,</l>
<l n="48.177">And into the net he drove them,</l>
<l n="48.178">In the net with floats a hundred.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.179">Rested now the smith his oars;</l>
<l n="48.180">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="48.181">Now the net himself drew upward,</l>
<l n="48.182">At the rope as he was pulling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.183">Said the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="48.184">"We have caught a shoal of fishes,</l>
<l n="48.185">In the net that I am lifting,</l>
<l n="48.186">With a hundred floats provided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.187">Then the net was soon drawn upward,</l>
<l n="48.188">And they drew it up and shook it</l>
<l n="48.189">In the boat of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="48.190">Finding mid the shoal of fishes,</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
<l n="48.191">That for which the net was fashioned,</l>
<l n="48.192">And the hundred floats provided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.193">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="48.194">To the land then urged the vessel,</l>
<l n="48.195">To the blue bridge-side he brought it,</l>
<l n="48.196">To the red bridge-end he brought it,</l>
<l n="48.197">There the shoal of fishes sorted,</l>
<l n="48.198">Turned the heap of bony fishes,</l>
<l n="48.199">And the grey pike found among them,</l>
<l n="48.200">Which he long had sought to capture.</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.201">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="48.202">Thus unto himself reflected:</l>
<l n="48.203">"Is it wise with hands to seize it,</l>
<l n="48.204">Save with gauntlets made of iron,</l>
<l n="48.205">Save with gloves of stone constructed,</l>
<l n="48.206">Save with mittens made of copper?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.207">And the Sun's son heard him speaking,</l>
<l n="48.208">And replied in words that follow:</l>
<l n="48.209">"I myself would rip the pike up,</l>
<l n="48.210">Venture in my hand to take him,</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
<l n="48.211">If I had my large knife only,</l>
<l n="48.212">Which my noble father gave me.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.213">Then from heaven the knife descended,</l>
<l n="48.214">From the clouds the knife fell downward,</l>
<l n="48.215">Golden-hafted, silver-bladed,</l>
<l n="48.216">To the Sun's son's belt dropped downward.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.217">Thereupon the Sun's son seized it,</l>
<l n="48.218">Firmly in his hand he grasped it,</l>
<l n="48.219">And with this the pike ripped open,</l>
<l n="48.220">Cleft the body of the Broad-snout,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="48.221">And within the grey pike's belly</l>
<l n="48.222">There the grey trout he discovered,</l>
<l n="48.223">And within the grey trout's belly</l>
<l n="48.224">There he found the smooth-skinned powan.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.225">Then he split the smooth-skinned powan,</l>
<l n="48.226">And a blue clew he discovered,</l>
<l n="48.227">In the powan's entrails hidden,</l>
<l n="48.228">In the third fold of the entrails.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.229">Then the blue clew he unwinded;</l>
<l n="48.230">From the inside of the blue clew</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
<l n="48.231">Fell a red clew from within it,</l>
<l n="48.232">And when he unwound the red clew,</l>
<l n="48.233">In the middle of the red clew,</l>
<l n="48.234">There he found a spark of fire</l>
<l n="48.235">Which had once from heaven descended,</l>
<l n="48.236">Through the clouds had fallen downward,</l>
<l n="48.237">From above eight heavens descending,</l>
<l n="48.238">From the ninth aërial region.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.239">Väinämöinen then considered</l>
<l n="48.240">How the spark might best be carried,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="48.241">To the cold and fireless dwellings,</l>
<l n="48.242">To the rooms so dark and gloomy.</l>
<l n="48.243">But the fire flashed up most fiercely,</l>
<l n="48.244">From the Sun's son's hands who held it,</l>
<l n="48.245">Singed the beard of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="48.246">Burned the smith much more severely,</l>
<l n="48.247">For upon his cheeks it burned him,</l>
<l n="48.248">And upon his hands it scorched him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.249">And it hastened quickly onward</l>
<l n="48.250">O'er the waves of Lake of Alue,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="48.251">Through the junipers fled onward,</l>
<l n="48.252">Burnt its way through all the thicket,</l>
<l n="48.253">Then rushed upward through the fir-trees,</l>
<l n="48.254">Burning up the stately fir-trees,</l>
<l n="48.255">Rushing ever further onward,</l>
<l n="48.256">Burned up half the land of Pohja,</l>
<l n="48.257">And the furthest bounds of Savo,</l>
<l n="48.258">Over both halves of Carelia.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.259">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="48.260">Followed hard upon its traces,</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="48.261">And he hastened through the forest,</l>
<l n="48.262">Close behind the furious fire,</l>
<l n="48.263">And at length he overtook it,</l>
<l n="48.264">'Neath the roots of two great tree-stumps,</l>
<l n="48.265">In the stumps of alders hidden,</l>
<l n="48.266">In the rotten stumps he found it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.267">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="48.268">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="48.269">"Fire, whom Jumala created,</l>
<l n="48.270">Creature of the bright Creator,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="48.271">Idly to the depths thou goest,</l>
<l n="48.272">Aimlessly to distant regions.</l>
<l n="48.273">It were better far to hide thee</l>
<l n="48.274">In the hearth of stone constructed,</l>
<l n="48.275">There thy sparks to bind together,</l>
<l n="48.276">And within the coals enclose them,</l>
<l n="48.277">That by day thou may'st be flickering</l>
<l n="48.278">In the kitchen birchen faggots,</l>
<l n="48.279">And at night thou may'st be hidden</l>
<l n="48.280">Close within the golden fire-box."</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.281">Then he thrust the spark of fire</l>
<l n="48.282">In a little piece of tinder,</l>
<l n="48.283">In the fungus hard of birch-tree,</l>
<l n="48.284">And among the copper kettles.</l>
<l n="48.285">Fire he carried to the kettles,</l>
<l n="48.286">Took it in the bark of birch-tree,</l>
<l n="48.287">To the end of misty headland,</l>
<l n="48.288">And the shady island's summit.</l>
<l n="48.289">Now was fire within the dwellings,</l>
<l n="48.290">In the rooms again 'twas shining.</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.291">But the smith named Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="48.292">Quickly hastened to the lakeshore,</l>
<l n="48.293">Where the rocks the water washes,</l>
<l n="48.294">And upon the rocks he sat him,</l>
<l n="48.295">In the pain of burning fire,</l>
<l n="48.296">In the anguish of its glowing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="48.297">There it was he quenched the fire,</l>
<l n="48.298">There it was he dimmed its lustre,</l>
<l n="48.299">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="48.300">And in words like these expressed him:</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="48.301">"Fire whom Jumala created</l>
<l n="48.302">And O thou, the Sun's son, Panu!</l>

<lg>
<l n="48.307">"How shall I the fire extinguish,</l>
<l n="48.308">How shall I reduce its glowing,</l>
<l n="48.309">Make the fire for evil powerless,</l>
<l n="48.310">And its lustre render harmless,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="48.311">That no longer it may pain me,</l>

<l n="48.313">"Come, thou girl, from land of Turja,</l>

<head>FALSE AND TRUE MOONS AND SUNS</head>
<div type="argument">
Ilmarinen forges a new moon and sun but cannot make them shine (1-74). Väinämöinen discovers by divination that the moon and sun are hidden in the mountain of Pohjola, goes to Pohjola and conquers the whole nation (75-230). He sees the moon and sun in the mountain, but cannot enter (231-278). He returns home to procure tools with which to break open the mountain. While Ilmarinen is forging them, the Mistress of Pohjola, fearing that it may go ill with her, releases the moon and sun (279-362). When Väinämöinen sees the moon and sun reappear in the sky, he salutes them, hoping that they will always go brightly on their course, and bring happiness to the country (363-422).

<l n="49.001">Still the sun was never shining,</l>

<l n="49.025">And the girls took likewise counsel,</l>
<l n="49.026">And their cousins too considered;</l>
<l n="49.027">And they hastened to the smithy,</l>
<l n="49.028">And they spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.029">"Smith, from 'neath the wall arise thou,</l>
<l n="49.030">From the hearthstone rise, O craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">30</ref>
<l n="49.031">That a new moon thou may'st forge us,</l>
<l n="49.032">And a new sun thou may'st make us.</l>
<l n="49.033">Ill it is without the moonlight,</l>
<l n="49.034">Strange it is without the sunlight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.035">From the hearth arose the craftsman,</l>
<l n="49.036">From beneath the wall the craftsman,</l>
<l n="49.037">That a new moon he might forge them,</l>
<l n="49.038">And a new sun he might make them,</l>
<l n="49.039">And a moon of gold constructed,</l>
<l n="49.040">And a sun he made of silver.</l><ref type="line number">40</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.041">Came the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="49.042">And beside the door he sat him,</l>
<l n="49.043">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.044">"O thou smith, my dearest brother,</l>
<l n="49.045">What art thou in smithy forging,</l>
<l n="49.046">Hammering thus without cessation?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.047">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="49.048">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="49.049">"Out of gold a moon I'm shaping,</l>
<l n="49.050">And a sun of silver making,</l><ref type="line number">50</ref>
<l n="49.051">In the sky I then will place them,</l>
<l n="49.052">Over six of starry heavens.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.053">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.054">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="49.055">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="49.056">What you make is wholly useless.</l>
<l n="49.057">Gold will never shine like moonlight,</l>
<l n="49.058">Silver will not shine like sunlight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.059">Thus the smith a moon constructed,</l>
<l n="49.060">And a sun completely finished,</l><ref type="line number">60</ref>
<l n="49.061">Eagerly he raised them upward,</l>
<l n="49.062">Raised them to the best position,</l>
<l n="49.063">Raised the moon to fir-tree's summit,</l>
<l n="49.064">Set the sun upon a pine-tree.</l>
<l n="49.065">From his head the sweat was streaming,</l>
<l n="49.066">From his forehead sweat was falling,</l>
<l n="49.067">With the greatness of his efforts,</l>
<l n="49.068">And the weight that he was lifting.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.069">Thus the moon was now uplifted,</l>
<l n="49.070">In his place the sun was stationed,</l><ref type="line number">70</ref>
<l n="49.071">Moon amid the crown of fir-tree,</l>
<l n="49.072">Sun upon a pine-tree's summit,</l>
<l n="49.073">But the moon shed forth no lustre,</l>
<l n="49.074">And the sun was likewise rayless.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.075">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.076">Spoke aloud the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.077">"Time it is the lots to shuffle,</l>
<l n="49.078">And the signs with care to question</l>
<l n="49.079">Where the sun is hidden from us,</l>
<l n="49.080">And the moon has vanished from us."</l><ref type="line number">80</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.081">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="49.082">He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
<l n="49.083">Hastened alder-sticks to cut him,</l>
<l n="49.084">And arranged the sticks in order,</l>
<l n="49.085">And began the lots to shuffle,</l>
<l n="49.086">With his fingers to arrange them,</l>
<l n="49.087">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="49.088">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="49.089">"Leave I ask of the Creator,</l>
<l n="49.090">Seek an answer that misleads not.</l><ref type="line number">90</ref>
<l n="49.091">Tell me, signs of the Creator,</l>
<l n="49.092">Lots of Jumala, instruct me,</l>
<l n="49.093">Where the sun is hidden from us,</l>
<l n="49.094">And the moon has vanished from us,</l>
<l n="49.095">Since no more as time elapses,</l>
<l n="49.096">In the sky do we behold them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.097">"Speak, O lot, and tell me truly</l>
<l n="49.098">With man's reason speak unto me,</l>
<l n="49.099">Speak thou faithful words unto us,</l>
<l n="49.100">Make thou faithful compacts with us!</l><ref type="line number">100</ref>
<l n="49.101">If the lot should lie unto me,</l>
<l n="49.102">Then its worth I hold as nothing,</l>
<l n="49.103">And upon the fire will cast it,</l>
<l n="49.104">And will burn the signs upon it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.105">And the lot spoke words most faithful,</l>
<l n="49.106">And the signs made answer truly,</l>
<l n="49.107">For they said the sun was hidden,</l>
<l n="49.108">And the moon was also sunken,</l>
<l n="49.109">Deep in Pohjola's stone mountain,</l>
<l n="49.110">And within the hill of copper.</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.111">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="49.112">Uttered then the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.113">"I to Pohjola must journey,</l>
<l n="49.114">On the path of Pohja's children,</l>
<l n="49.115">And will bring the moon to shining,</l>
<l n="49.116">And the golden sun to shining.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.117">Forth he journeyed, and he hastened</l>
<l n="49.118">Unto Pohjola's dark regions,</l>
<l n="49.119">And he walked one day, a second,</l>
<l n="49.120">And at length upon the third day</l><ref type="line number">120</ref>
<l n="49.121">Came in view the gate of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.122">And appeared the rocky mountains.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.123">Then with all his strength he shouted,</l>
<l n="49.124">As he came to Pohja's river,</l>
<l n="49.125">"Bring me here a boat directly</l>
<l n="49.126">Which shall take me o'er the river.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.127">As his shouting was not heeded,</l>
<l n="49.128">And no boat for him provided,</l>
<l n="49.129">Wood into a heap he gathered,</l>
<l n="49.130">And the dead twigs of a fir-tree.</l><ref type="line number">130</ref>
<l n="49.131">On the shore he made a fire,</l>
<l n="49.132">And thick clouds of smoke rose upward;</l>
<l n="49.133">To the sky the flame rose upward,</l>
<l n="49.134">In the air the smoke ascended.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.135">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress</l>
<l n="49.136">Came herself unto the window,</l>
<l n="49.137">And, at the sound's opening gazing,</l>
<l n="49.138">Then she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.139">"What's the flame that's burning yonder,</l>
<l n="49.140">Where the Sound of Saari opens?</l><ref type="line number">140</ref>
<l n="49.141">For a camp too small I think it,</l>
<l n="49.142">But 'tis larger than a fisher's.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.143">Then the son of Pohja's country</l>
<l n="49.144">Hurried out into the open,</l>
<l n="49.145">And he looked about and listened,</l>
<l n="49.146">Seeking thus for information.</l>
<l n="49.147">"On the river's other margin,</l>
<l n="49.148">Is a stately hero marching.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.149">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.150">Once again commenced his shouting.</l><ref type="line number">150</ref>
<l n="49.151">"Bring a boat, O son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.152">Bring a boat for Väinämöinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.153">Answer made the son of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.154">And in words like these responded:</l>
<l n="49.155">"Here the boats are never ready;</l>
<l n="49.156">You to row must use your fingers,</l>
<l n="49.157">And must use your hands for rudder,</l>
<l n="49.158">Crossing Pohjola's deep river.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.159">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.160">Pondered deeply and reflected,</l><ref type="line number">160</ref>
<l n="49.161">"Not as man should he be reckoned</l>
<l n="49.162">Who retreats upon his pathway.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.163">Like a pike in lake then plunging,</l>
<l n="49.164">Powan-like in sluggish river,</l>
<l n="49.165">Through the sound he swam right quickly,</l>
<l n="49.166">Speedily the strait he traversed,</l>
<l n="49.167">And he moved one foot, a second,</l>
<l n="49.168">And he reached the shore of Pohja.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.169">Then spoke out the sons of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.170">And the evil army shouted:</l><ref type="line number">170</ref>
<l n="49.171">"Go into the yard of Pohja,"</l>
<l n="49.172">And on this the yard he entered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.173">Then exclaimed the sons of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.174">And the evil army shouted:</l>
<l n="49.175">"Enter now the house of Pohja."</l>
<l n="49.176">And on this the house he entered,</l>
<l n="49.177">On the floor his foot he planted,</l>
<l n="49.178">Grasped he the door-handle firmly,</l>
<l n="49.179">Forced his way into the dwelling,</l>
<l n="49.180">And beneath the roof he entered,</l><ref type="line number">180</ref>
<l n="49.181">There the men the mead were drinking,</l>
<l n="49.182">And the honey-drink imbibing.</l>
<l n="49.183">All the men with swords were girded,</l>
<l n="49.184">And the heroes aimed their weapons</l>
<l n="49.185">At the head of Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="49.186">Thus to slay Suvantolainen.</l>
<l n="49.187">Then they questioned the intruder</l>
<l n="49.188">In the very words that follow:</l>
<l n="49.189">"What's your news, you wretched fellow,</l>
<l n="49.190">What's your need, O swimming hero?"</l><ref type="line number">190</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.191">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="49.192">Answered in the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.193">"Of the moon are curious tidings,</l>
<l n="49.194">Of the sun are wondrous tidings.</l>
<l n="49.195">Where is now the sun imprisoned,</l>
<l n="49.196">Whither has the moon been taken?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.197">Answered then the sons of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.198">And the evil army answered:</l>
<l n="49.199">"Thus it is the sun is hidden,</l>
<l n="49.200">Sun is hidden, moon imprisoned,</l><ref type="line number">200</ref>
<l n="49.201">In the stones of many colours,</l>
<l n="49.202">In the rocks as hard as iron,</l>
<l n="49.203">And from this, escape they cannot,</l>
<l n="49.204">And release shall never reach them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.205">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.206">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="49.207">"If the sun from rock ascends not,</l>
<l n="49.208">Nor the moon from rocky mountain,</l>
<l n="49.209">Let us join in closest conflict,</l>
<l n="49.210">Let us grasp our trusty sword-blades."</l><ref type="line number">210</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.211">Sword they drew, and tried their sword-blades,</l>
<l n="49.212">Drew from out the sheaths their weapons;</l>
<l n="49.213">At the point the moon was shining,</l>
<l n="49.214">On the hilt the sun was shining,</l>
<l n="49.215">On the back a horse was standing,</l>
<l n="49.216">At the knob a cat was mewing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.217">After this the swords they measured,</l>
<l n="49.218">And they thus compared their weapons,</l>
<l n="49.219">And the sword of aged Väinö</l>
<l n="49.220">Was a little trifle longer,</l><ref type="line number">220</ref>
<l n="49.221">Longer, as a grain of barley,</l>
<l n="49.222">As the width of straw-stalk longer.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.223">Out into the yard they hastened,</l>
<l n="49.224">On the grass to meet in conflict,</l>
<l n="49.225">And the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.226">Struck a blow with lightning swiftness,</l>
<l n="49.227">Struck a blow, and struck a second,</l>
<l n="49.228">And he sheared, like roots of turnips,</l>
<l n="49.229">Off he shore, like heads of flax-plant,</l>
<l n="49.230">Heads of all the sons of Pohja.</l><ref type="line number">230</ref>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.231">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.232">Sought for where the moon was hidden,</l>
<l n="49.233">Likewise would release the sunlight</l>
<l n="49.234">From the rocks of varied colour,</l>
<l n="49.235">From the depths of steely mountain,</l>
<l n="49.236">From the rocks as hard as iron.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.237">Then he walked a little distance,</l>
<l n="49.238">But a very little distance,</l>
<l n="49.239">When he saw a copse all verdant,</l>
<l n="49.240">In the copse a lovely birch-tree,</l><ref type="line number">240</ref>
<l n="49.241">And a large stone block beneath it,</l>
<l n="49.242">And a rock beneath the stone block,</l>
<l n="49.243">And there were nine doors before it,</l>
<l n="49.244">In the doors were bolts a hundred.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.245">In the stone a crack perceiving,</l>
<l n="49.246">In the rock some lines engraven,</l>
<l n="49.247">Then he drew his sword from scabbard,</l>
<l n="49.248">On the coloured stone he scraped it,</l>
<l n="49.249">With the sharp point of his sword-blade,</l>
<l n="49.250">With his gleaming blade he scraped it,</l><ref type="line number">250</ref>
<l n="49.251">Till the stone in two divided,</l>
<l n="49.252">And in three he quickly split it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.253">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="49.254">Looked into the stone all pictured;</l>
<l n="49.255">Many serpents ale were drinking,</l>
<l n="49.256">In the wort the snakes were writhing,</l>
<l n="49.257">In the coloured stone were hiding,</l>
<l n="49.258">In the cracks of liver-colour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.259">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="49.260">Uttered then the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">260</ref>
<l n="49.261">"Thus it is the hapless Mistress</l>
<l n="49.262">Has so little ale acquired,</l>
<l n="49.263">For the snakes the ale are drinking,</l>
<l n="49.264">In the wort the snakes are writhing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.265">Off he cut the heads of serpents,</l>
<l n="49.266">Broke the necks of all the serpents,</l>
<l n="49.267">And he spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="49.268">And in words like these expressed him:</l>
<l n="49.269">"Never while the world existeth,</l>
<l n="49.270">From this very day henceforward,</l><ref type="line number">270</ref>
<l n="49.271">Let our ale by snakes be drunken,</l>
<l n="49.272">And our malt-drink by the serpents.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.273">Then the aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="49.274">He the great primeval sorcerer,</l>
<l n="49.275">Sought with hands the doors to open,</l>
<l n="49.276">And the bolts by spells to loosen,</l>
<l n="49.277">But to hands the doors would yield not,</l>
<l n="49.278">By his spells the bolts were moved not.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.279">Then the aged Väinämöinen</l>
<l n="49.280">Spoke his thoughts in words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">280</ref>
<l n="49.281">"Man unarmed is weak as woman;</l>
<l n="49.282">Weak as frog, without a hatchet."</l>
<l n="49.283">And at once he wended homeward,</l>
<l n="49.284">Head bowed down, in great vexation,</l>
<l n="49.285">For the moon was not recovered,</l>
<l n="49.286">Neither had the sun been captured.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.287">Said the lively Lemminkainen,</l>
<l n="49.288">"O thou aged Väinämöinen,</l>
<l n="49.289">Wherefore didst forget to take me,</l>
<l n="49.290">As your very trusty comrade?</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="49.291">I had brought the locks to creaking,</l>
<l n="49.292">And the bars asunder broken,</l>
<l n="49.293">And released the moon for shining,</l>
<l n="49.294">And had raised the sun for shining.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.295">Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,</l>
<l n="49.296">Answered in the words that follow:</l>
<l n="49.297">"Unto spells the bolts will yield not,</l>
<l n="49.298">And the locks my magic breaks not;</l>
<l n="49.299">Strength of hands will never move them,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.301">To the smith's forge then he wandered,</l>
<l n="49.302">And he spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="49.303">"O thou smith, O Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="49.304">Forge me now a mighty trident,</l>
<l n="49.305">And a dozen hatchets forge me,</l>
<l n="49.306">And a bunch of keys enormous,</l>
<l n="49.307">From the stone the moon to rescue,</l>
<l n="49.308">From the rock the sun deliver.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.309">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen,</l>
<l n="49.310">He the great primeval craftsman,</l><ref type="line number">310</ref>
<l n="49.311">Forged the hero what he needed,</l>
<l n="49.312">And a dozen hatchets forged him,</l>
<l n="49.313">Forged a bunch of keys enormous,</l>
<l n="49.314">And of spears a mighty bundle,</l>
<l n="49.315">Not too large and not too little,</l>
<l n="49.316">But of middle size he forged them.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.317">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>
<l n="49.318">Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,</l>
<l n="49.319">Then with wings herself provided,</l>
<l n="49.320">And extended them for flying,</l><ref type="line number">320</ref>
<l n="49.321">Near the house at first was flying,</l>
<l n="49.322">Then her flight extended further,</l>
<l n="49.323">Straight across the lake of Pohja</l>
<l n="49.324">Unto Ilmarinen's smithy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.325">Then the smith his window opened,</l>
<l n="49.326">Looking if the wind was blowing;</l>
<l n="49.327">'Twas no wind that there was blowing,</l>
<l n="49.328">But a hawk, and grey in colour.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.329">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="49.330">Spoke aloud the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="49.331">"Bird of prey, what brings thee hither,</l>
<l n="49.332">Sitting underneath my window?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.333">Hereupon the bird spoke language,</l>

<l n="49.339">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="49.340">Answered in the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">340</ref>
<l n="49.341">"But indeed 'tis not a wonder</l>

<l n="49.345">Hereupon the bird spoke language,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="49.349">Thereupon smith Ilmarinen</l>
<l n="49.350">Answered in the words that follow:</l><ref type="line number">350</ref>

<l n="49.355">Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,</l>

<lg>
<l n="49.361">From the stone the moon released she,</l>

<head>MARJATTA</head>
<div type="argument">
The virgin Marjatta swallows a cranberry and brings forth a boy (1-346). The child disappears and is found after a long search in a swamp (347-430). He is taken to an old man to be baptized, but the latter will not baptize the fatherless child until after due consideration (431-440). Väinämöinen comes to inquire into the matter, and advises that the ill-omened boy should be put to death, but the child reproaches him for his unjust sentence (441-474). The old man baptizes the boy as King of Carelia, at which Väinämöinen is grievously offended and leaves the country, but first declares that he will again make a new Sampo and kantele, and light for the people. He sails away in a copper boat to a land between earth and heaven, but he leaves behind his kantele and his great songs as a parting gift to his people (475-512). Concluding verses (513-620).

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.009">And she wore out half the threshold,</l>
<l n="50.010">With her skirts as she was passing,</l><ref type="line number">10</ref>
<l n="50.011">And she half destroyed the rafters</l>

<l n="50.014">As her fine sleeves rubbed against them,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.017">Marjatta the petted damsel</l>

<l n="50.021">And she fed on fish the finest,</l>
<l n="50.022">And the soft bark of the fir-tree,</l>
<l n="50.023">But the eggs of hens ate never,</l>
<l n="50.024">Over which the cocks were crowing,</l>
<l n="50.025">And the flesh of ewe she ate not,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.027">If her mother sent her milking,</l>
<l n="50.028">Yet she did not go to milking,</l>
<l n="50.029">And she spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="50.031">Udders of the cows should handle,</l>
<l n="50.032">Which with bulls have been disporting,</l>

<l n="50.034">Or from calf it is not running.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.035">If her father sent her sledging,</l>
<l n="50.036">In a stallion's sledge she went not,</l>
<l n="50.037">If a mare her brother brought her,</l>
<l n="50.038">Then these words the maiden uttered:</l>

<l n="50.041">If no foals the sledge are drawing,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.049">On the hill the sheep were straying,</l>

<l n="50.051">On the plain the maiden wandered,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.055">Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.073">Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>
<l n="50.074">For a while lived on as herd-girl.</l>
<l n="50.075">Evil is the life of shepherd,</l>
<l n="50.076">Far too heavy for a maiden;</l>
<l n="50.077">In the grass a snake is creeping,</l>

<l n="50.081">From the hill there cried a berry,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.107">From the heath a stick she lifted,</l>

<l n="50.110">Upward to her shoes so pretty,</l><ref type="line number">110</ref>
<l n="50.111">From her pretty shoes arose it,</l>

<l n="50.123">Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.127">Then she cast aside her girdle,</l>
<l n="50.128">Loosely dressed, without a girdle,</l>
<l n="50.129">Secretly she sought the bathroom,</l>

<l n="50.167">Marjatta the petted damsel,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.179">For a bath she asked her father,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.185">But her father gave her answer,</l>

<l n="50.231">Hills re-echoed to her footsteps,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.237">In his shirt sat wicked Ruotus,</l>

<l n="50.241">And he asked as he was eating,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.245">Then the little damsel Piltti</l>
<l n="50.246">Answered in the words that follow:</l>

<l n="50.251">Then the wicked wife of Ruotus</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.261">Then the wicked wife of Ruotus</l>
<l n="50.262">Answered in the words that follow:</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.271">Then the little maiden Piltti,</l>

<l n="50.276">None beside the rush-fringed streamlet,</l>
<l n="50.277">And the wicked wife of Ruotus,</l>
<l n="50.278">Only spoke the words which follow:</l>

<l n="50.287">This was all she said unto me,</l>
<l n="50.288">This is truly what she answered.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.289">Marjatta the hapless maiden</l>
<l n="50.290">When she heard, burst forth in weeping,</l><ref type="line number">290</ref>
<l n="50.291">And she spoke the words that follow:</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.297">In her hands her skirt she lifted,</l>
<l n="50.298">With her hands her skirt she twisted,</l>
<l n="50.299">And she took the bath-whisks with her,</l>
<l n="50.300">Of the softest leaves and branches,</l><ref type="line number">300</ref>
<l n="50.301">And with hasty steps went onward,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.305">And she spoke the words which follow,</l>
<l n="50.306">And in words like these expressed her:</l>
<l n="50.307">"Come thou to my aid, Creator,</l>
<l n="50.308">To my aid, O thou most gracious,</l>
<l n="50.309">In this anxious time of labour,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="50.315">When at length her journey ended,</l>
<l n="50.316">Then she spoke the words which follow:</l>
<l n="50.317">"O thou good horse, breathe upon me,</l>

<l n="50.323">Then the good horse breathed upon her,</l>

<l n="50.326">When the horse desisted breathing,</l>
<l n="50.327">Steam was spread throughout the stable,</l>
<l n="50.328">Like the steam of boiling water.</l>

<l n="50.330">She, the holy little maiden,</l><ref type="line number">330</ref>
<l n="50.331">Bathed her in a bath sufficient,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.507">There he rested with his vessel,</l>

<l n="50.562">I was small when died my mother,</l>

<l n="50.567">Or to sing as sings the throstle,</l>
<l n="50.568">In the wardship of a stranger,</l>
<l n="50.569">At the will of a step-mother,</l>
<l n="50.570">And she drove me forth, unhappy,</l>
<l n="50.571">Forth she drove the unloved infant,</l><ref type="line number">570</ref>
<l n="50.572">To a wind-swept home she drove me,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.576">Like a lark away I wandered,</l>
<l n="50.577">Like a hapless bird I wandered</l>

<l n="50.579">Wearily I wandered onward,</l>

<l n="50.584">Even now do many people,</l>

<l n="50.588">Curses on my tongue they shower,</l>

<l n="50.591">And they call my songs too lengthy,</l><ref type="line number">590</ref>
<l n="50.592">And they say I sing too badly,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.594">May you not, O friendly people,</l>
<l n="50.595">As a wondrous thing regard it</l>
<l n="50.596">That I sang so much in childhood,</l>
<l n="50.597">And when small, I sang so badly.</l>
<l n="50.598">I received no store of learning,</l>
<l n="50.599">Never travelled to the learned.</l>
<l n="50.600">Foreign words were never taught me,</l>
<l n="50.601">Neither songs from distant countries.</l><ref type="line number">600</ref>
<l n="50.602">Others have had all instruction,</l>
<l n="50.603">From my home I journeyed never,</l>
<l n="50.604">Always did I help my mother,</l>
<l n="50.605">And I dwelt for ever near her,</l>
<l n="50.606">In the house received instruction,</l>
<l n="50.607">'Neath the rafters of my storehouse,</l>
<l n="50.608">By the spindle of my mother,</l>
<l n="50.609">By my brother's heap of shavings,</l>

<lg>
<l n="50.612">But let this be as it may be,</l>
<l n="50.613">I have shown the way to singers,</l>
<l n="50.614">Showed the way, and broke the tree-tops,</l>
<l n="50.615">Cut the branches, shown the pathways.</l>
<l n="50.616">This way therefore leads the pathway,</l>
<l n="50.617">Here the path lies newly opened,</l>
<l n="50.618">Widely open for the singers,</l>
<l n="50.619">And for greater ballad singers,</l>
<l n="50.620">For the young, who now are growing,</l>
<l n="50.621">For the rising generation.</l><ref type="line number">620</ref>
