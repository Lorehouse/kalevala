	<l>	Mastered by desire impulsive,</l>
	<l>	By a mighty inward urging,</l>
	<l>	I am ready now for singing,</l>
	<l>	Ready to begin the chanting</l>
	<l>	Of our nation’s ancient folk-song</l>
	<l>	Handed down from by-gone ages.</l>
	<l>	In my mouth the words are melting,</l>
	<l>	From my lips the tones are gliding,</l>
	<l>	From my tongue they wish to hasten;</l>
	<l>	When my willing teeth are parted,</l>
	<l>	When my ready mouth is opened,</l>
	<l>	Songs of ancient wit and wisdom</l>
	<l>	Hasten from me not unwilling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
	<l>	Golden friend, and dearest brother,</l>
	<l>	Brother dear of mine in childhood,</l>
	<l>	Come and sing with me the stories,</l>
	<l>	Come and chant with me the legends,</l>
	<l>	Legends of the times forgotten,</l>
	<l>	Since we now are here together,</l>
	<l>	Come together from our roamings.</l>
	<l>	Seldom do we come for singing,</l>
	<l>	Seldom to the one, the other,</l>
	<l>	O’er this cold and cruel country,</l>
	<l>	O’er the poor soil of the Northland.</l>
	<l>	Let us clasp our hands together</l>
	<l>	That we thus may best remember.</l>
	<l>	Join we now in merry singing,</l>
	<l>	Chant we now the oldest folk-lore,</l>
	<l>	That the dear ones all may hear them,</l>
	<l>	That the well-inclined may hear them,</l>
	<l>	Of this rising generation.</l>
	<l>	These are words in childhood taught me,</l>
	<l>	Songs preserved from distant ages,</l>
	<l>	Legends they that once were taken</l>
	<l>	From the belt of Wainamoinen,</l>
	<l>	From the forge of Ilmarinen,</l>
	<l>	From the sword of Kaukomieli,</l>
	<l>	From the bow of Youkahainen,</l>
	<l>	From the pastures of the Northland,</l>
	<l>	From the meads of Kalevala.</l>
	<l>	These my dear old father sang me</l>
	<l>	When at work with knife and hatchet</l>
	<l>	These my tender mother taught me</l>
	<l>	When she twirled the flying spindle,</l>
	<l>	When a child upon the matting</l>
	<l>	By her feet I rolled and tumbled.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
	<l>	Incantations were not wanting</l>
	<l>	Over Sampo and o’er Louhi,</l>
	<l>	Sampo growing old in singing,</l>
	<l>	Louhi ceasing her enchantment.</l>
	<l>	In the songs died wise Wipunen,</l>
	<l>	At the games died Lemminkainen.</l>
	<l>	There are many other legends,</l>
	<l>	Incantations that were taught me,</l>
	<l>	That I found along the wayside,</l>
	<l>	Gathered in the fragrant copses,</l>
	<l>	Blown me from the forest branches,</l>
	<l>	Culled among the plumes of pine-trees,</l>
	<l>	Scented from the vines and flowers,</l>
	<l>	Whispered to me as I followed</l>
	<l>	Flocks in land of honeyed meadows,</l>
	<l>	Over hillocks green and golden,</l>
	<l>	After sable-haired Murikki,</l>
	<l>	And the many-colored Kimmo.</l>
	<l>	Many runes the cold has told me,</l>
	<l>	Many lays the rain has brought me,</l>
	<l>	Other songs the winds have sung me;</l>
	<l>	Many birds from many forests,</l>
	<l>	Oft have sung me lays in concord</l>
	<l>	Waves of sea, and ocean billows,</l>
	<l>	Music from the many waters,</l>
	<l>	Music from the whole creation,</l>
	<l>	Oft have been my guide and master.</l>
	<l>	Sentences the trees created,</l>
	<l>	Rolled together into bundles,</l>
	<l>	Moved them to my ancient dwelling,</l>
	<l>	On the sledges to my cottage,</l>
	<l>	Tied them to my garret rafters,</l>
	<l>	Hung them on my dwelling-portals,</l>
	<l>	Laid them in a chest of boxes,</l>
	<l>	Boxes lined with shining copper.</l>
	<l>	Long they lay within my dwelling</l>
	<l>	Through the chilling winds of winter,</l>
	<l>	In my dwelling-place for ages.</l>
</lg>
	<l>	Shall I bring these songs together</l>
	<l>	From the cold and frost collect them?</l>
	<l>	Shall I bring this nest of boxes,</l>
	<l>	Keepers of these golden legends,</l>
	<l>	To the table in my cabin,</l>
	<l>	Underneath the painted rafters,</l>
	<l>	In this house renowned and ancient?</l>
	<l>	Shall I now these boxes open,</l>
	<l>	Boxes filled with wondrous stories?</l>
	<l>	Shall I now the end unfasten</l>
	<l>	Of this ball of ancient wisdom,</l>
	<l>	These ancestral lays unravel?</l>
	<l>	Let me sing an old-time legend,</l>
	<l>	That shall echo forth the praises</l>
	<l>	Of the beer that I have tasted,</l>
	<l>	Of the sparkling beer of barley.</l>
	<l>	Bring to me a foaming goblet</l>
	<l>	Of the barley of my fathers,</l>
	<l>	Lest my singing grow too weary,</l>
	<l>	Singing from the water only.</l>
	<l>	Bring me too a cup of strong-beer,</l>
	<l>	It will add to our enchantment,</l>
	<l>	To the pleasure of the evening,</l>
	<l>	Northland’s long and dreary evening,</l>
	<l>	For the beauty of the day-dawn,</l>
	<l>	For the pleasure of the morning,</l>
	<l>	The beginning of the new-day.</l>
<lg>
	<l>	Often I have heard them chanting,</l>
	<l>	Often I have heard them singing,</l>
	<l>	That the nights come to us singly,</l>
	<l>	That the Moon beams on us singly,</l>
	<l>	That the Sun shines on us singly;</l>
	<l>	Singly also, Wainamoinen,</l>
	<l>	The renowned and wise enchanter,</l>
	<l>	Born from everlasting Ether</l>
	<l>	Of his mother, Ether’s daughter.</l>
