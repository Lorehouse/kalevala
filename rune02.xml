    <head type="title">WAINAMOINEN’S SOWING.</head>
<lg>
<l>Then arose old Wainamoinen,</l>
<l>With his feet upon the island,</l>
<l>On the island washed by ocean,</l>
<l>Broad expanse devoid of verdure;</l>
<l>There remained he many summers,</l>
<l>There he lived as many winters,</l>
<l>On the island vast and vacant,</l>
<l>Well considered, long reflected,</l>
<l>Who for him should sow the island,</l>
<l>Who for him the seeds should scatter;</l>
<l>Thought at last of Pellerwoinen,</l>
<l>First-born of the plains and prairies,</l>
<l>When a slender boy, called Sampsa,</l>
<l>Who should sow the vacant island,</l>
<l>Who the forest seeds should scatter.</l>
<l>Pellerwoinen, thus consenting,</l>
<l>Sows with diligence the island,</l>
<l>Seeds upon the lands he scatters,</l>
<l>Seeds in every swamp and lowland,</l>
<l>Forest seeds upon the loose earth,</l>
<l>On the firm soil sows the acorns,</l>
<l>Fir-trees sows he on the mountains,</l>
<l>Pine-trees also on the hill-tops,</l>
<l>Many shrubs in every valley,</l>
<l>Birches sows he in the marshes,</l>
<l>In the loose soil sows the alders,</l>
<l>In the lowlands sows the lindens,</l>
<l>In the moist earth sows the willow,</l>
<l>Mountain-ash in virgin places,</l>
<l>On the banks of streams the hawthorn,</l>
<l>Junipers in hilly regions;</l>
<l>This the work of Pellerwoinen,</l>
<l>Slender Sampsa, in his childhood.</l>
<l>Soon the fertile seeds were sprouting,</l>
<l>Soon the forest trees were growing,</l>
<l>Soon appeared the tops of fir-trees,</l>
<l>And the pines were far outspreading;</l>
<l>Birches rose from all the marshes,</l>
<l>In the loose soil grew the alders,</l>
<l>In the mellow soil the lindens;</l>
<l>Junipers were also growing,</l>
<l>Junipers with clustered berries,</l>
<l>Berries on the hawthorn branches.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now the hero, Wainamoinen,</l>
<l>Stands aloft to look about him,</l>
<l>How the Sampsa-seeds are growing,</l>
<l>How the crop of Pellerwoinen;</l>
<l>Sees the young trees thickly spreading,</l>
<l>Sees the forest rise in beauty;</l>
<l>But the oak-tree has not sprouted,</l>
<l>Tree of heaven is not growing,</l>
<l>Still within the acorn sleeping,</l>
<l>Its own happiness enjoying.</l>
<l>Then he waited three nights longer,</l>
<l>And as many days he waited,</l>
<l>Waited till a week had vanished,</l>
<l>Then again the work examined;</l>
<l>But the oak-tree was not growing,</l>
<l>Had not left her acorn-dwelling.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,</l>
<l>Spies four maidens in the distance,</l>
<l>Water-brides, he spies a fifth-one,</l>
<l>On the soft and sandy sea-shore,</l>
<l>In the dewy grass and flowers,</l>
<l>On a point extending seaward,</l>
<l>Near the forests of the island.</l>
<l>Some were mowing, some were raking,</l>
<l>Raking what was mown together,</l>
<l>In a windrow on the meadow.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>From the ocean rose a giant,</l>
<l>Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy,</l>
<l>Pressed compactly all the grasses,</l>
<l>That the maidens had been raking,</l>
<l>When a fire within them kindles,</l>
<l>And the flames shot up to heaven,</l>
<l>Till the windrows burned to ashes,</l>
<l>Only ashes now remaining</l>
<l>Of the grasses raked together.</l>
<l>In the ashes of the windrows,</l>
<l>Tender leaves the giant places,</l>
<l>In the leaves he plants an acorn,</l>
<l>From the acorn, quickly sprouting,</l>
<l>Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,</l>
<l>From the ground enriched by ashes,</l>
<l>Newly raked by water-maidens;</l>
<l>Spread the oak-tree’s many branches,</l>
<l>Rounds itself a broad corona,</l>
<l>Raises it above the storm-clouds;</l>
<l>Far it stretches out its branches,</l>
<l>Stops the white-clouds in their courses,</l>
<l>With its branches hides the sunlight,</l>
<l>With its many leaves, the moonbeams,</l>
<l>And the starlight dies in heaven.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</l>
<l>Thought awhile, and well considered,</l>
<l>How to kill the mighty oak-tree,</l>
<l>First created for his pleasure,</l>
<l>How to fell the tree majestic,</l>
<l>How to lop its hundred branches.</l>
<l>Sad the lives of man and hero,</l>
<l>Sad the homes of ocean-dwellers,</l>
<l>If the sun shines not upon them,</l>
<l>If the moonlight does not cheer them!</l>
<l>Is there not some mighty hero,</l>
<l>Was there never born a giant,</l>
<l>That can fell the mighty oak-tree,</l>
<l>That can lop its hundred branches?</l>
<l>Wainamoinen, deeply thinking,</l>
<l>Spake these words soliloquizing:</l>
<l>“Kapé, daughter of the Ether,</l>
<l>Ancient mother of my being,</l>
<l>Luonnotar, my nurse and helper,</l>
<l>Loan to me the water-forces,</l>
<l>Great the powers of the waters;</l>
<l>Loan to me the strength of oceans,</l>
<l>To upset this mighty oak-tree,</l>
<l>To uproot this tree of evil,</l>
<l>That again may shine the sunlight,</l>
<l>That the moon once more may glimmer.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Straightway rose a form from ocean,</l>
<l>Rose a hero from the waters,</l>
<l>Nor belonged he to the largest,</l>
<l>Nor belonged he to the smallest,</l>
<l>Long was he as man’s forefinger,</l>
<l>Taller than the hand of woman;</l>
<l>On his head a cap of copper,</l>
<l>Boots upon his feet were copper,</l>
<l>Gloves upon his hands were copper,</l>
<l>And its stripes were copper-colored,</l>
<l>Belt around him made of copper,</l>
<l>Hatchet in his belt was copper;</l>
<l>And the handle of his hatchet</l>
<l>Was as long as hand of woman,</l>
<l>Of a finger’s breadth the blade was.</l>
<l>Then the trusty Wainamoinen</l>
<l>Thought awhile and well considered,</l>
<l>And his measures are as follow:</l>
<l>“Art thou, sir, divine or human?</l>
<l>Which of these thou only knowest;</l>
<l>Tell me what thy name and station.</l>
<l>Very like a man thou lookest,</l>
<l>Hast the bearing of a hero,</l>
<l>Though the length of man’s first finger,</l>
<l>Scarce as tall as hoof of reindeer.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Then again spake Wainamoinen</l>
<l>To the form from out the ocean:</l>
<l>“Verily I think thee human,</l>
<l>Of the race of pigmy-heroes,</l>
<l>Might as well be dead or dying,</l>
<l>Fit for nothing but to perish.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Answered thus the pigmy-hero,</l>
<l>Spake the small one from the ocean</l>
<l>To the valiant Wainamoinen:</l>
<l>“Truly am I god and hero,</l>
<l>From the tribes that rule the ocean;</l>
<l>Come I here to fell the oak-tree,</l>
<l>Lop its branches with my hatchet.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</l>
<l>Answers thus the sea-born hero:</l>
<l>“Never hast thou force sufficient,</l>
<l>Not to thee has strength been given,</l>
<l>To uproot this mighty oak-tree,</l>
<l>To upset this thing of evil,</l>
<l>Nor to lop its hundred branches.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Scarcely had he finished speaking,</l>
<l>Scarcely had he moved his eyelids,</l>
<l>Ere the pigmy full unfolding,</l>
<l>Quick becomes a mighty giant.</l>
<l>With one step he leaves the ocean,</l>
<l>Plants himself, a mighty hero,</l>
<l>On the forest-fields surrounding;</l>
<l>With his head the clouds he pierces,</l>
<l>To his knees his beard extending,</l>
<l>And his locks fall to his ankles;</l>
<l>Far apart appear his eyeballs,</l>
<l>Far apart his feet are stationed,</l>
<l>Farther still his mighty shoulders.</l>
<l>Now begins his axe to sharpen,</l>
<l>Quickly to an edge he whets it,</l>
<l>Using six hard blocks of sandstone,</l>
<l>And of softer whetstones, seven.</l>
<l>Straightway to the oak-tree turning,</l>
<l>Thither stalks the mighty giant,</l>
<l>In his raiment long and roomy,</l>
<l>Flapping in the winds of heaven;</l>
<l>With his second step he totters</l>
<l>On the land of darker color;</l>
<l>With his third stop firmly planted,</l>
<l>Reaches he the oak-tree’s branches,</l>
<l>Strikes the trunk with sharpened hatchet,</l>
<l>With one mighty swing he strikes it,</l>
<l>With a second blow he cuts it;</l>
<l>As his blade descends the third time,</l>
<l>From his axe the sparks fly upward,</l>
<l>From the oak-tree fire outshooting;</l>
<l>Ere the axe descends a fourth time,</l>
<l>Yields the oak with hundred branches,</l>
<l>Shaking earth and heaven in falling.</l>
<l>Eastward far the trunk extending,</l>
<l>Far to westward flew the tree-tops,</l>
<l>To the South the leaves were scattered,</l>
<l>To the North its hundred branches.</l>
<l>Whosoe’er a branch has taken,</l>
<l>Has obtained eternal welfare;</l>
<l>Who secures himself a tree-top,</l>
<l>He has gained the master magic;</l>
<l>Who the foliage has gathered,</l>
<l>Has delight that never ceases.</l>
<l>Of the chips some had been scattered,</l>
<l>Scattered also many splinters,</l>
<l>On the blue back of the ocean,</l>
<l>Of the ocean smooth and mirrored,</l>
<l>Rocked there by the winds and waters,</l>
<l>Like a boat upon the billows;</l>
<l>Storm-winds blew them to the Northland,</l>
<l>Some the ocean currents carried.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Northland’s fair and slender maiden,</l>
<l>Washing on the shore a head-dress,</l>
<l>Beating on the rocks her garments,</l>
<l>Rinsing there her silken raiment,</l>
<l>In the waters of Pohyola,</l>
<l>There beheld the chips and splinters,</l>
<l>Carried by the winds and waters.</l>
<l>In a bag the chips she gathered,</l>
<l>Took them to the ancient court-yard,</l>
<l>There to make enchanted arrows,</l>
<l>Arrows for the great magician,</l>
<l>There to shape them into weapons,</l>
<l>Weapons for the skilful archer,</l>
<l>Since the mighty oak has fallen,</l>
<l>Now has lost its hundred branches,</l>
<l>That the North may see the sunshine,</l>
<l>See the gentle gleam of moonlight,</l>
<l>That the clouds may keep their courses,</l>
<l>May extend the vault of heaven</l>
<l>Over every lake and river,</l>
<l>O’er the banks of every island.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Groves arose in varied beauty,</l>
<l>Beautifully grew the forests,</l>
<l>And again, the vines and flowers.</l>
<l>Birds again sang in the tree-tops,</l>
<l>Noisily the merry thrushes,</l>
<l>And the cuckoos in the birch-trees;</l>
<l>On the mountains grew the berries,</l>
<l>Golden flowers in the meadows,</l>
<l>And the herbs of many colors,</l>
<l>Many kinds of vegetation;</l>
<l>But the barley is not growing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</l>
<l>Goes away and well considers,</l>
<l>By the borders of the waters,</l>
<l>On the ocean’s sandy margin,</l>
<l>Finds six seeds of golden barley,</l>
<l>Even seven ripened kernels,</l>
<l>On the shore of upper Northland,</l>
<l>In the sand upon the sea-shore,</l>
<l>Hides them in his trusty pouches,</l>
<l>Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,</l>
<l>Some were made from skin of marten;</l>
<l>Hastens forth the seeds to scatter,</l>
<l>Quickly sows the barley kernels,</l>
<l>On the brinks of Kalew-waters,</l>
<l>On the Osma-hills and lowlands.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hark! the titmouse wildly crying,</l>
<l>From the aspen, words as follow:</l>
<l>“Osma’s barley will not flourish,</l>
<l>Not the barley of Wainola,</l>
<l>If the soil be not made ready,</l>
<l>If the forest be not levelled,</l>
<l>And the branches burned to ashes.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
<l>Made himself an axe for chopping,</l>
<l>Then began to clear the forest,</l>
<l>Then began the trees to level,</l>
<l>Felled the trees of all descriptions,</l>
<l>Only left the birch-tree standing</l>
<l>For the birds a place of resting,</l>
<l>Where might sing the sweet-voiced cuckoo,</l>
<l>Sacred bird in sacred branches.</l>
<l>Down from heaven came the eagle,</l>
<l>Through the air he came a-flying,</l>
<l>That he might this thing consider;</l>
<l>And he spake the words that follow:</l>
<l>“Wherefore, ancient Wainamoinen,</l>
<l>Hast thou left the slender birch-tree,</l>
<l>Left the birch-tree only standing?”</l>
<l>Wainamoinen thus made answer:</l>
<l>“Therefore is the birch left standing,</l>
<l>That the birds may nest within it,</l>
<l>That the eagle there may rest him,</l>
<l>There may sing the sacred cuckoo.”</l>
<l>Spake the eagle, thus replying:</l>
<l>“Good indeed, thy hero-judgment,</l>
<l>That the birch-tree thou hast left us,</l>
<l>Left the sacred birch-tree standing,</l>
<l>As a resting-place for eagles,</l>
<l>And for birds of every feather,</l>
<l>Even I may rest upon it.”</l>
<l>Quickly then this bird of heaven,</l>
<l>Kindled fire among the branches;</l>
<l>Soon the flames are fanned by north-winds,</l>
<l>And the east-winds lend their forces,</l>
<l>Burn the trees of all descriptions,</l>
<l>Burn them all to dust and ashes,</l>
<l>Only is the birch left standing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
<l>Brings his magic grains of barley,</l>
<l>Brings he forth his seven seed-grains,</l>
<l>Brings them from his trusty pouches,</l>
<l>Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,</l>
<l>Some were made from skin of marten.</l>
<l>Thence to sow his seeds he hastens,</l>
<l>Hastes the barley-grains to scatter,</l>
<l>Speaks unto himself these measures:</l>
<l>“I the seeds of life am sowing,</l>
<l>Sowing through my open fingers,</l>
<l>From the hand of my Creator,</l>
<l>In this soil enriched with ashes,</l>
<l>In this soil to sprout and flourish.</l>
<l>Ancient mother, thou that livest</l>
<l>Far below the earth and ocean,</l>
<l>Mother of the fields and forests,</l>
<l>Bring the rich soil to producing,</l>
<l>Bring the seed-grains to the sprouting,</l>
<l>That the barley well may flourish.</l>
<l>Never will the earth unaided,</l>
<l>Yield the ripe nutritious barley;</l>
<l>Never will her force be wanting,</l>
<l>If the givers give assistance,</l>
<l>If the givers grace the sowing,</l>
<l>Grace the daughters of creation.</l>
<l>Rise, O earth, from out thy slumber,</l>
<l>From the slumber-land of ages,</l>
<l>Let the barley-grains be sprouting,</l>
<l>Let the blades themselves be starting,</l>
<l>Let the verdant stalks be rising,</l>
<l>Let the ears themselves be growing,</l>
<l>And a hundredfold producing,</l>
<l>From my plowing and my sowing,</l>
<l>From my skilled and honest labor.</l>
<l>Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,</l>
<l>Thou O Father of the heavens,</l>
<l>Thou that livest high in Ether,</l>
<l>Curbest all the clouds of heaven,</l>
<l>Holdest in the air thy counsel,</l>
<l>Holdest in the clouds good counsel,</l>
<l>From the East dispatch a cloudlet,</l>
<l>From the North-east send a rain-cloud,</l>
<l>From the West another send us,</l>
<l>From the North-west, still another,</l>
<l>Quickly from the South a warm-cloud,</l>
<l>That the rain may fall from heaven,</l>
<l>That the clouds may drop their honey,</l>
<l>That the ears may fill and ripen,</l>
<l>That the barley-fields may rustle.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thereupon benignant Ukko,</l>
<l>Ukko, father of the heavens,</l>
<l>Held his counsel in the cloud-space,</l>
<l>Held good counsel in the Ether;</l>
<l>From the East, he sent a cloudlet,</l>
<l>From the North-east, sent a rain-cloud,</l>
<l>From the West another sent he,</l>
<l>From the North-west, still another,</l>
<l>Quickly from the South a warm-cloud;</l>
<l>Joined in seams the clouds together,</l>
<l>Sewed together all their edges,</l>
<l>Grasped the cloud, and hurled it earthward.</l>
<l>Quick the rain-cloud drops her honey,</l>
<l>Quick the rain-drops fall from heaven,</l>
<l>That the ears may quickly ripen,</l>
<l>That the barley crop may rustle.</l>
<l>Straightway grow the seeds of barley,</l>
<l>From the germ the blade unfolding,</l>
<l>Richly colored ears arising,</l>
<l>From the rich soil of the fallow,</l>
<l>From the work of Wainamoinen.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Here a few days pass unnoted</l>
<l>And as many nights fly over.</l>
<l>When the seventh day had journeyed,</l>
<l>On the morning of the eighth day,</l>
<l>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</l>
<l>Went to view his crop of barley,</l>
<l>How his plowing, how his sowing,</l>
<l>How his labors were resulting;</l>
<l>Found his crop of barley growing,</l>
<l>Found the blades were triple-knotted,</l>
<l>And the ears he found six-sided.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</l>
<l>Turned his face, and looked about him,</l>
<l>Lo! there comes a spring-time cuckoo,</l>
<l>Spying out the slender birch-tree,</l>
<l>Rests upon it, sweetly singing:</l>
<l>“Wherefore is the silver birch-tree</l>
<l>Left unharmed of all the forest?”</l>
<l>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</l>
<l>“Therefore I have left the birch-tree,</l>
<l>Left the birch-tree only growing,</l>
<l>Home for thee for joyful singing.</l>
<l>Call thou here, O sweet-voiced cuckoo,</l>
<l>Sing thou here from throat of velvet,</l>
<l>Sing thou here with voice of silver,</l>
<l>Sing the cuckoo’s golden flute-notes;</l>
<l>Call at morning, call at evening,</l>
<l>Call within the hour of noontide,</l>
<l>For the better growth of forests,</l>
<l>For the ripening of the barley,</l>
<l>For the richness of, the Northland,</l>
<l>For the joy of Kalevala.”</l>
