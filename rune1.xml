	<head>BIRTH OF WAINAMOINEN.</head>
	<lg>
		<l>In primeval times, a maiden,</l>
		<l>Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,</l>
		<l>Passed for ages her existence</l>
		<l>In the great expanse of heaven,</l>
		<l>O’er the prairies yet enfolded.</l>
		<l>Wearisome the maiden growing,</l>
		<l>Her existence sad and hopeless,</l>
		<l>Thus alone to live for ages</l>
		<l>In the infinite expanses</l>
		<l>Of the air above the sea-foam,</l>
		<l>In the far outstretching spaces,</l>
		<l>In a solitude of ether,</l>
		<l>She descended to the ocean,</l>
		<l>Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.</l>
		<l>Thereupon the rising storm-wind</l>
		<l>Flying from the East in fierceness,</l>
		<l>Whips the ocean into surges,</l>
		<l>Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean</l>
		<l>Till the waves are white with fervor.</l>
		<l>To and fro they toss the maiden,</l>
		<l>Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;</l>
		<l>With her sport the rolling billows,</l>
		<l>With her play the storm-wind forces,</l>
		<l>On the blue back of the waters;</l>
		<l>On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,</l>
		<l>Play the forces of the salt-sea,</l>
		<l>With the lone and helpless maiden;</l>
		<l>Till at last in full conception,</l>
		<l>Union now of force and beauty,</l>
		<l>Sink the storm-winds into slumber;</l>
		<l>Overburdened now the maiden</l>
		<l>Cannot rise above the surface;</l>
		<l>Seven hundred years she wandered,</l>
		<l>Ages nine of man’s existence,</l>
		<l>Swam the ocean hither, thither,</l>
		<l>Could not rise above the waters,</l>
		<l>Conscious only of her travail;</l>
		<l>Seven hundred years she labored</l>
		<l>Ere her first-born was delivered.</l>
		<l>Thus she swam as water-mother,</l>
		<l>Toward the east, and also southward,</l>
		<l>Toward the west, and also northward;</l>
		<l>Swam the sea in all directions,</l>
		<l>Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,</l>
		<l>Swam in travail, swam unceasing,</l>
		<l>Ere her first-born was delivered.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Then began she gently weeping,</l>
		<l>Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:</l>
		<l>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated!</l>
		<l>Woe is me, in this my travail!</l>
		<l>Into what have I now fallen?</l>
		<l>Woe is me, that I unhappy,</l>
		<l>Left my home in subtle ether,</l>
		<l>Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,</l>
		<l>To be tossed by rolling billows,</l>
		<l>To be rocked by winds and waters,</l>
		<l>On the far outstretching waters,</l>
		<l>In the salt-sea’s vast expanses,</l>
		<l>Knowing only pain and trouble!</l>
		<l>Better far for me, O Ukko!</l>
		<l>Were I maiden in the Ether,</l>
		<l>Than within these ocean-spaces,</l>
		<l>To become a water-mother!</l>
		<l>All this life is cold and dreary,</l>
		<l>Painful here is every motion,</l>
		<l>As I linger in the waters,</l>
		<l>As I wander through the ocean.</l>
		<l>Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,</l>
		<l>Thou the ruler of the heavens,</l>
		<l>Come thou hither, thou art needed,</l>
		<l>Come thou hither, I implore thee,</l>
		<l>To deliver me from trouble,</l>
		<l>To deliver me in travail.</l>
		<l>Come I pray thee, hither hasten,</l>
		<l>Hasten more that thou art needed,</l>
		<l>Haste and help this helpless maiden!”</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>When she ceased her supplications,</l>
		<l>Scarce a moment onward passes,</l>
		<l>Ere a beauteous duck descending,</l>
		<l>Hastens toward the water-mother,</l>
		<l>Comes a-flying hither, thither,</l>
		<l>Seeks herself a place for nesting.</l>
		<l>Flies she eastward, flies she westward,</l>
		<l>Circles northward, circles southward,</l>
		<l>Cannot find a grassy hillock,</l>
		<l>Not the smallest bit of verdure;</l>
		<l>Cannot find a spot protected,</l>
		<l>Cannot find a place befitting,</l>
		<l>Where to make her nest in safety.</l>
		<l>Flying slowly, looking round her,</l>
		<l>She descries no place for resting,</l>
		<l>Thinking loud and long debating,</l>
		<l>And her words are such as follow:</l>
		<l>“Build I in the winds my dwelling,</l>
		<l>On the floods my place of nesting?</l>
		<l>Surely would the winds destroy it,</l>
		<l>Far away the waves would wash it.”</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Then the daughter of the Ether,</l>
		<l>Now the hapless water-mother,</l>
		<l>Raised her shoulders out of water,</l>
		<l>Raised her knees above the ocean,</l>
		<l>That the duck might build her dwelling,</l>
		<l>Build her nesting-place in safety.</l>
		<l>Thereupon the duck in beauty,</l>
		<l>Flying slowly, looking round her,</l>
		<l>Spies the shoulders of the maiden,</l>
		<l>Sees the knees of Ether’s daughter,</l>
		<l>Now the hapless water-mother,</l>
		<l>Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,</l>
		<l>On the blue back of the ocean.</l>
		<l>Thence she flies and hovers slowly,</l>
		<l>Lightly on the knee she settles,</l>
		<l>Finds a nesting-place befitting,</l>
		<l>Where to lay her eggs in safety.</l>
		<l>Here she builds her humble dwelling,</l>
		<l>Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,</l>
		<l>Six, the golden eggs she lays there,</l>
		<l>Then a seventh, an egg of iron;</l>
		<l>Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,</l>
		<l>Quickly warms them on the knee-cap</l>
		<l>Of the hapless water-mother;</l>
		<l>Hatches one day, then a second,</l>
		<l>Then a third day sits and hatches.</l>
		<l>Warmer grows the water round her,</l>
		<l>Warmer is her bed in ocean,</l>
		<l>While her knee with fire is kindled,</l>
		<l>And her shoulders too are burning,</l>
		<l>Fire in every vein is coursing.</l>
		<l>Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,</l>
		<l>Shakes her members in succession,</l>
		<l>Shakes the nest from its foundation,</l>
		<l>And the eggs fall into ocean,</l>
		<l>Dash in pieces on the bottom</l>
		<l>Of the deep and boundless waters.</l>
		<l>In the sand they do not perish,</l>
		<l>Not the pieces in the ocean;</l>
		<l>But transformed, in wondrous beauty</l>
		<l>All the fragments come together</l>
		<l>Forming pieces two in number,</l>
		<l>One the upper, one the lower,</l>
		<l>Equal to the one, the other.</l>
		<l>From one half the egg, the lower,</l>
		<l>Grows the nether vault of Terra:</l>
		<l>From the upper half remaining,</l>
		<l>Grows the upper vault of Heaven;</l>
		<l>From the white part come the moonbeams,</l>
		<l>From the yellow part the sunshine,</l>
		<l>From the motley part the starlight,</l>
		<l>From the dark part grows the cloudage;</l>
		<l>And the days speed onward swiftly,</l>
		<l>Quickly do the years fly over,</l>
		<l>From the shining of the new sun</l>
		<l>From the lighting of the full moon.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Still the daughter of the Ether,</l>
		<l>Swims the sea as water-mother,</l>
		<l>With the floods outstretched before her,</l>
		<l>And behind her sky and ocean.</l>
		<l>Finally about the ninth year,</l>
		<l>In the summer of the tenth year,</l>
		<l>Lifts her head above the surface,</l>
		<l>Lifts her forehead from the waters,</l>
		<l>And begins at last her workings,</l>
		<l>Now commences her creations,</l>
		<l>On the azure water-ridges,</l>
		<l>On the mighty waste before her.</l>
		<l>Where her hand she turned in water,</l>
		<l>There arose a fertile hillock;</l>
		<l>Wheresoe’er her foot she rested,</l>
		<l>There she made a hole for fishes;</l>
		<l>Where she dived beneath the waters,</l>
		<l>Fell the many deeps of ocean;</l>
		<l>Where upon her side she turned her,</l>
		<l>There the level banks have risen;</l>
		<l>Where her head was pointed landward,</l>
		<l>There appeared wide bays and inlets;</l>
		<l>When from shore she swam a distance,</l>
		<l>And upon her back she rested,</l>
		<l>There the rocks she made and fashioned,</l>
		<l>And the hidden reefs created,</l>
		<l>Where the ships are wrecked so often,</l>
		<l>Where so many lives have perished.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Thus created were the islands,</l>
		<l>Rocks were fastened in the ocean,</l>
		<l>Pillars of the sky were planted,</l>
		<l>Fields and forests were created,</l>
		<l>Checkered stones of many colors,</l>
		<l>Gleaming in the silver sunlight,</l>
		<l>All the rocks stood well established;</l>
		<l>But the singer, Wainamoinen,</l>
		<l>Had not yet beheld the sunshine,</l>
		<l>Had not seen the golden moonlight,</l>
		<l>Still remaining undelivered.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</l>
		<l>Lingering within his dungeon</l>
		<l>Thirty summers altogether,</l>
		<l>And of winters, also thirty,</l>
		<l>Peaceful on the waste of waters,</l>
		<l>On the broad-sea’s yielding bosom,</l>
		<l>Well reflected, long considered,</l>
		<l>How unborn to live and flourish</l>
		<l>In the spaces wrapped in darkness,</l>
		<l>In uncomfortable limits,</l>
		<l>Where he had not seen the moonlight,</l>
		<l>Had not seen the silver sunshine.</l>
		<l>Thereupon these words he uttered,</l>
		<l>Let himself be heard in this wise:</l>
		<l>“Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,</l>
		<l>Take me, thou, O Sun above me,</l>
		<l>Take me, thou, O Bear of heaven,</l>
		<l>From this dark and dreary prison,</l>
		<l>From these unbefitting portals,</l>
		<l>From this narrow place of resting,</l>
		<l>From this dark and gloomy dwelling,</l>
		<l>Hence to wander from the ocean,</l>
		<l>Hence to walk upon the islands,</l>
		<l>On the dry land walk and wander,</l>
		<l>Like an ancient hero wander,</l>
		<l>Walk in open air and breathe it,</l>
		<l>Thus to see the moon at evening,</l>
		<l>Thus to see the silver sunlight,</l>
		<l>Thus to see the Bear in heaven,</l>
		<l>That the stars I may consider.”</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Since the Moon refused to free him,</l>
		<l>And the Sun would not deliver,</l>
		<l>Nor the Great Bear give assistance,</l>
		<l>His existence growing weary,</l>
		<l>And his life but an annoyance,</l>
		<l>Bursts he then the outer portals</l>
		<l>Of his dark and dismal fortress;</l>
		<l>With his strong, but unnamed finger,</l>
		<l>Opens he the lock resisting;</l>
		<l>With the toes upon his left foot,</l>
		<l>With the fingers of his right hand,</l>
		<l>Creeps he through the yielding portals</l>
		<l>To the threshold of his dwelling;</l>
		<l>On his knees across the threshold,</l>
		<l>Throws himself head foremost, forward</l>
		<l>Plunges into deeps of ocean,</l>
		<l>Plunges hither, plunges thither,</l>
		<l>Turning with his hands the water;</l>
		<l>Swims he northward, swims he southward,</l>
		<l>Swims he eastward, swims he westward,</l>
		<l>Studying his new surroundings.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg>
		<l>Thus our hero reached the water,</l>
		<l>Rested five years in the ocean,</l>
		<l>Six long years, and even seven years,</l>
		<l>Till the autumn of the eighth year,</l>
		<l>When at last he leaves the waters,</l>
		<l>Stops upon a promontory,</l>
		<l>On a coast bereft of verdure;</l>
		<l>On his knees he leaves the ocean,</l>
		<l>On the land he plants his right foot,</l>
		<l>On the solid ground his left foot,</l>
		<l>Quickly turns his hands about him,</l>
		<l>Stands erect to see the sunshine,</l>
		<l>Stands to see the golden moonlight,</l>
		<l>That he may behold the Great Bear,</l>
		<l>That he may the stars consider.</l>
		<l>Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,</l>
		<l>Thus the wonderful enchanter</l>
		<l>Was delivered from his mother,</l>
		<l>Ilmatar, the Ether’s daughter.</l>
